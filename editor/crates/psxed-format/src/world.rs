//! Shared contract for cooked grid-world assets.
//!
//! Each `.psxw` blob is a fixed-size grid room: a world header, one
//! sector record per grid cell, then a compact wall table referenced
//! by sectors.
//!
//! # Versions
//!
//! `VERSION = 1` (current shipping):
//!   - Heights are `[i32; 4]` per face → 16 B per height set
//!   - Sector record = 44 B, wall record = 24 B
//!   - No material table — slot ids resolve via an external bank
//!   - No sector logic stream
//!
//! `VERSION = 2` (designed, not yet wired through the cooker):
//!   - Heights are room-local `[i16; 4]` → 8 B per set
//!   - Sector record = **28 B**, wall record = **12 B** (a 36 % / 50 %
//!     reduction on the two records that dominate the wire size)
//!   - Embedded material table so a `.psxw` is self-resolving
//!   - `sector_logic_offset` referencing a sparse byte stream for
//!     triggers / slopes / portals (adaptive's FloorData idea)
//!
//! See `WorldHeaderV2`, `SectorRecordV2`, `WallRecordV2`,
//! `MaterialRecordV2` below — each asserts its own size at compile
//! time so layout drift fails the build.
