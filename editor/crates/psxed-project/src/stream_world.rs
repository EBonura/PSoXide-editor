//! Deterministic stress-world generator for world streaming (design
//! 2026-10-08, milestone M8, generator half).
//!
//! A grid of square modules (rooms, hallways, partitioned interiors, walled
//! courtyards, terrain patches) joined by a randomised spanning tree plus a
//! few loop edges, sealed under a roof, with the two existing enemy archetypes
//! placed at spawn points, a player start, and a route set (shortest paths, a
//! sprint, random walks, a backtrack exercise, hook edges) written as data for
//! later tape generation.
//!
//! # Density is a construction rule, not a seed lottery
//!
//! The streaming gates ask three things of a world: a region's payload fits
//! the region budget, what one position needs resident (its closure, the lead
//! ring and the home pin) fits the RAM pool, and the bytes entering that set
//! per unit of travel fit the drive. All three follow from how many regions a
//! region sees and how many bytes a region holds, so the generator bounds both
//! by construction:
//!
//! * **Door degree.** No module has more than `max_door_degree` doors. The
//!   spanning tree and the loop edges both respect it, so a region has at most
//!   that many neighbours.
//! * **Vestibules.** Every door is screened by a baffle a few units inside
//!   it. A sight line through a door ends on the baffle, so a region sees its
//!   door neighbours (their vestibules) and nobody behind them. That bounds
//!   the closure to `1 + max_door_degree` regions, which is what the pool is
//!   sized for ([`PoolPlan`]).
//! * **Roof.** Every module is closed overhead (a ceiling, or the sky material
//!   on a courtyard or terrain patch), and the walls reach it. There is no
//!   open air layer for sight lines to run through, and no cell of sky.
//! * **Hook rooms are dead ends.** A hook pulls the closure of its landing
//!   room into the requirement of every region that sees it and is in hook
//!   range. A room with one door is seen only from its one neighbour, so a
//!   hook adds one room's worth of bytes, not a junction's.
//! * **Budget.** Each module is built to stay under `region_target_bytes` in
//!   the cut search's own byte model, so the cook never cuts through a module:
//!   a cell is a module, and its closure is its door neighbours. The shell,
//!   the vestibules and the hook pedestal are mandatory; the interior detail
//!   of a kind is added in priority order while it fits, and terrain patches
//!   pick the finest resolution that fits. A module whose mandatory shell
//!   already exceeds the budget is reported in the stats, not hidden.
//! * **Patch size.** `patch_extent_authored` is the cooker's own surface
//!   subdivision; the default is its coarsest (4096 authored, 256 units).
//!
//! What the world asks of the RAM pool, and what the RAM can give, is stated
//! by [`PoolPlan`] from [`RAM_BUDGET`]; see `StreamWorldConfig::pool_plan`.
//!
//! It looks like Graybox Reach on purpose: the donor project supplies every
//! material, character, model and the world settings. Output is reproducible
//! from a small config, so the project is regenerated on demand and not
//! tracked; see `editor/projects/stream-world.config.ron`.
//!
//! Units: modules are laid out in engine units (the Quake-scale units the
//! cooker uses) and written to the project in authored units (x16).
