//! Automatic world partitioner for streamed worlds (design 2026-10-08,
//! sections 3 and 4, milestone M4).
//!
//! Host only. Nothing here changes the PXBSP format or the runtime: the
//! partitioner reads the same brush world the cooker compiles, decides where
//! to cut it, accounts the payload of every region, estimates what each
//! region needs resident, and judges the result against the drive and the
//! RAM pool. The output is a [`Partition`] and a deterministic report.
//!
//! Labels used in comments and in the report mirror the design:
//! `[M]` measured or stated in code, `[D]` derived from `[M]` values, `[E]`
//! an estimate or tunable default to be replaced by a measurement.
//!
//! Pipeline, one module per stage:
//! 1. [`input`]: scale to engine units, run the shared CSG/subdivision front
//!    end, collect spawns, hooks and the player start.
//! 2. [`cuts`]: top-down axis-aligned bisection of the world (the cut tree).
//! 3. [`account`]: clip surfaces to each cell, build the cell's own surface
//!    BSP, cost its collision, and total the payload.
//! 4. [`graph`]: open-aperture adjacency between cells and walk distances.
//! 5. [`closure`]: which regions can be seen from where (V(R)), and the
//!    resident requirement Need(R) including hook edges.
//! 6. [`gate`]: rank-row width, bytes-per-unit-of-travel (rho) and RAM pool
//!    checks, all as named, labelled parameters.
//! 7. [`layout`]: disc order for seek locality.
//! 8. [`report`]: text and JSON, both byte-stable for equal inputs.
//!
//! Deliberate simplifications versus the design, each repeated in the report
//! where it matters: cuts are axis-aligned only; visibility is a sampled
//! line-of-sight estimate over the brush solids rather than leaf-level portal
//! flow; archetype pack bytes are not yet measured and count as zero.
