# Copy-Paste Prompt For Worker 2: Demo3 Tile Visibility And PVS

Copy everything in this file into Worker 2.

```text
You are Worker 2 on the PSoXide demo3 performance pass.

Your assignment is issue 2 only: improve camera/tile-aware visibility and PVS so demo3 renders a better set of in-view geometry with fewer wasted room cells/surfaces/packets.

You are not alone in the codebase. Worker 1 is working separately on moving room surface cache build work out of the frame path. Do not revert their edits. Avoid editing Worker 1-owned cache build/storage code unless a tiny call-site adaptation is unavoidable.

Repository:
/home/user/Desktop/repos/PSoXide

Before doing architecture/codebase work, read:
sed -n '1,180p' AGENTS.md
sed -n '1,180p' graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md

Useful graph query:
graphify query "How do editor-playtest room surface caching, generated chunk visibility, and residency/streaming relate in this codebase?"

After modifying code files, run:
graphify update .

Use rg for search. Use apply_patch for manual edits. Do not use destructive git commands. Do not commit or push. Do not revert files you did not intentionally change.

Known dirty files at orchestration time, unrelated to this performance pass:
editor/crates/psxed-project/src/lib.rs
editor/crates/psxed-ui/src/lib.rs

Treat those as user/local work. Do not revert them. If your task genuinely requires touching either file, explain that in your final handoff and keep the edit narrowly scoped.

Architecture summary:
Demo3 is a geometry-heavy playtest level cooked into engine/examples/editor-playtest/generated/.

Current playtest path:
1. Editor/cooker creates room chunks and generated Rust manifest.
2. Runtime includes room/world/model/texture bytes through include_bytes!.
3. Runtime picks active chunk rooms near the player/camera.
4. Runtime builds or reads per-room surface caches.
5. Runtime uses generated visibility cell lists plus runtime camera/frustum tests to draw cached room surfaces.
6. World commands are sorted/flushed into the PS1 ordering table.

Your problem:
The current room visibility is still too broad and sometimes unstable. It selects too much geometry, and previous screenshots showed missing/oddly selected chunks. The world is quantized into cells/chunks, so visibility should exploit current chunk, local cell, yaw sector, frustum, and neighbour graph.

Primary goal:
Use camera/tile-aware visibility or a compact generated PVS so demo3 draws fewer wasted room cells/surfaces while preserving visible geometry. Prefer conservative false positives over missing floors/walls.

Baseline:
room cycles/frame:       2,989,336
room cells/frame:              405
room cells drawn/frame:        238
room surfaces/frame:           745
tri prims/frame:             1,294
room chunks/frame:               4

Target for first useful pass:
room cycles/frame below 2.4M without visual regression
room cells drawn meaningfully below 238/frame, or same cells with fewer submitted surfaces
tri prims below 1,100/frame if possible
no missing wall/floor holes in default demo3 screenshot
no obvious pop/stutter in 240-frame hold-forward run

Aggressive target:
room cycles/frame near or below 2.0M
room surfaces below about 550/frame
tri prims below about 1,000/frame

Current generated visibility data:
ROOM_VISIBILITY: one record per generated room/chunk
VISIBILITY_CELLS: list of cells for each room
LevelVisibilityCellRecord { room, x, z, min_y, max_y, portal_mask, blocker_mask, flags }

The user-observed visibility issues:
1. Geometry missing when looking around.
2. It does not render far enough when turning.
3. Earlier builds had chunks/geometry outside the intended view region always rendered.
4. The engine should focus on what is actually in view.
5. A possible approach is a precomputed list of offsets for each quantized camera/player position.

Suggested design:
Use a conservative two-stage visibility system.

Stage A: Runtime frustum refinement over existing generated visibility.
1. Keep existing ROOM_VISIBILITY / VISIBILITY_CELLS.
2. For each candidate visibility cell, compute a conservative world-space cell AABB or bounding sphere:
   x/z from cell coordinates and chunk origin
   sector_size from room/chunk
   min_y/max_y from LevelVisibilityCellRecord
   extra margin for walls/ceilings and PS1 ordering safety
3. Reject cells clearly outside the camera frustum.
4. Use a safety margin so walls/floors do not disappear at screen edges.
5. Never cull the player/current cell or immediately adjacent cells.
6. Prefer false positives over false negatives.

Stage B: Cooked quantized PVS, if Stage A alone is insufficient.
Add a compact generated table keyed by:
room/chunk index
observer cell x/z
camera yaw sector, probably 8 or 16 sectors

Each key maps to a short list of cell refs or cell ranges. Runtime chooses:
current generated room/chunk
current camera/player local cell
quantized yaw sector

then draws only that PVS list after Stage A frustum refinement.

Suggested records:
pub struct LevelVisibilityViewRecord {
    pub room: RoomIndex,
    pub cell_x: u16,
    pub cell_z: u16,
    pub yaw_sector: u8,
    pub first_ref: VisibilityCellIndex,
    pub ref_count: u16,
    pub flags: u16,
}

pub struct LevelVisibilityCellRefRecord {
    pub room: RoomIndex,
    pub x: u16,
    pub z: u16,
}

or use indices into VISIBILITY_CELLS if that is smaller and simpler.

Keep the schema compact. Avoid heap allocations. Avoid duplicating large full LevelVisibilityCellRecord entries per view if index refs are enough.

PVS heuristics:
The first PVS does not need perfect occlusion. It needs a conservative, stable win.

Good first heuristic:
1. Include current cell and neighbour ring unconditionally.
2. Include cells in a forward wedge from camera yaw.
3. Include cells behind the player only in a short radius.
4. Include chunks connected through neighbour graph if their bounds intersect the frustum.
5. Expand the wedge/radius near boundaries to prevent turn/movement popping.
6. Keep far cells if they project within the frustum and are not blocked by simple wall/portal metadata.

Use these generated fields where useful:
portal_mask
blocker_mask
flags
chunk neighbours north/east/south/west
room/chunk origin_x/origin_z/width/depth/sector_size

Ordering safety:
Do not fix visibility by dropping geometry that happens to draw in the wrong order. Visibility should answer: could this cell/surface be visible from this camera region? Ordering should remain handled by depth bands/OT sorting. If an ordering bug appears, report it separately and do not hide it with culling.

Tests to add:
1. PVS for a cell always includes itself.
2. PVS includes immediate neighbours or a safety ring.
3. PVS yaw sectors are stable at sector boundaries.
4. Frustum filter does not reject a cell whose AABB intersects the near screen area.
5. Generated PVS tables have valid offsets/counts.
6. Demo3 cook emits non-empty PVS/view records if you add generated PVS tables.

Because this task affects visibility/camera/active rooms, also run:

If your hash changes, include screenshot paths and explain visible differences. If visibility/PVS changes make more appropriate geometry visible, hash changes are acceptable, but you must explain what changed and verify there are no obvious holes/missing walls/floors in default demo3 and the 240-frame hold-forward capture.
