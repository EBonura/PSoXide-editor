# PS1 hardware-test disc

The `hardware-tests` disc is the silicon reference for PSoXide. It runs the
same executable in PSoXide and on a real PlayStation. Real-console data is
transported through QR payloads, so a TV/capture card is enough and no
character-by-character transcription is required.

## Versioning

Every payload carries a **suite version** alongside the transport schema
version. The schema says how bytes are laid out; the suite version says what a
record id *means*, which a schema version cannot express because an id can be
redefined without the layout changing.

`hwtest-report.py` refuses to diff captures across a MAJOR suite bump, since the
same id may name two different measurements. Baselines are named by version
rather than date. The bump rule and the full history of what each version
changed are in [hardware-test-versions.md](hardware-test-versions.md).

Current: **v2.0**, schema PX8. Not comparable with v0.18 captures, whose timing
was sampled without interrupt masking. v2.0 is a MAJOR bump from v1.28 because the
suite is one linear run now (see below); shared records keep their ids and meaning,
but the order they run in is different, and so is the state each one starts from.
What was removed and where each thing went: [hardware-test-v2-removed.md](hardware-test-v2-removed.md).

## The linear run (v2.0)

One entry on the menu, **RUN HARDWARE TEST**, runs everything in a fixed order
and ends in one capture. There is no second tier: nothing is a separate probe
you have to remember to run, and nothing runs twice. The only screens outside
the run are the two that need a person or touch the operator's card:
**CONTROLLER TEST (P1 + P2)** and **MEMORY CARD (AT OWN RISK)**; the menu also
has **VIEW LAST CAPTURE**.

The run is ten areas, 61 steps, in this order (`src/run.rs`):

| # | Area | Steps |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | BOOT SNAPSHOT | `BOOT STATE` (what the BIOS left, read before anything touches it), `KERNEL TIMING` |
| 1 | CPU AND RAM | cases, `CPU SWEEP`, `CPU AND BUS TIMING` |
| 2 | IRQ, DMA, TIMERS | cases, timing, `TIMER PRECISION`, `TIMER 1 HBLANK RATE`, `POLLED TIMER TICK LOSS` |
| 3 | GTE | cases, `GTE SWEEP`, `GTE TIMING`, `GTE COMMAND LATENCY`, `GTE PRECISION` |
| 4 | GPU, MDEC, DISPLAY | cases, timing and MDEC, `GPU BATCHES`, `MDEC DECODE`, precision, `RASTER HASHES`, `DISPLAY WIDTHS`, `480I INTERLACE` |
| 5 | SPU | `SPU INIT STATE`, precision, cases, `SPU MAP`, `SPU DMA TIMING`, `UI SAMPLE END AND LOOP` (SB1), `SPU RAM AND VOICES` (SB2), `CAPTURE RINGS` (SB4), `BANK HANDOFF` (PA4) |
| 6 | CD, XA, CD-DA, STREAM | cases, `CD POLLED TIMING`, `CD DATA VERSUS AUDIO ROUTE` (PA1), `CD READ MECHANISMS` (CL2), `XA MUSIC LOOP`, `STREAM COST`, `CD-DA HANDOFF` |
| 7 | SIO | cases, `SIO TIMING`, then the controller-port and pad-engine measurements described under "SIO measurements" below (select delay, pad and card `/ACK` timing, pad and card together, the engine's sweep, pacings, card lease and load, the DualShock motors, hot-plug) |
| 8 | PERFORMANCE | stack and lever cases, `WARM PROBES`, `EXTENDED PROBES AND SHAPES`, `DMA VERSUS CPU LOADS`, `MDEC DMA VERSUS CPU`, `AUDIT PROBES` |
| 9 | DRIVE AND BUS STRESS | `CD DMA VERSUS CPU`, `CD MOTOR` (waits up to 20 s), then `REGISTER A/B (CAN HANG)` |

**A reset between areas.** Each area starts with `reset_area`: the GPU reset
and the font uploaded again, every SPU voice keyed off with its volumes at
zero, the CD drive initialised and paused, every DMA channel idle, the
interrupt mask and our exception vector restored. Each area ends with a handoff
record (`0x410`-`0x419`) whose flag bits say whether it left the machine clean;
`0x3F` is clean. The GTE, which has no reset, is seeded where a step needs defined inputs.

**Silent.** Sound is made only inside the SPU, XA and CD-DA steps. The run ends by
keying every voice off, zeroing every volume, parking the CD drive and reading the SPU's
capture buffer back, and records that proof (`0x41A`, flags `0x7F` = silent) before
the QR pages come up. The v1.28 payload-as-audio tone, which was still sounding
at the end of a v1.28 capture, no longer exists.

**One risky step.** `REGISTER A/B (CAN HANG)` flips undocumented memory-controller
and cache-control bits around a timed workload, one at a time, with the record id on
screen. It is last, bounded, and skipped when **L2** is held as the run starts. If the
console hangs inside it the screen names the record; power-cycle and run again with L2
held. A hang at bus level cannot be pre-empted, which is the accepted trade.

**Hands off.** The run needs no input after CROSS on the first row, with two optional
exceptions in the SIO area: the `DUALSHOCK MOTORS` step asks, for each motor level, whether the pad
vibrated (CROSS yes, CIRCLE no; the question shows for a second with the pad ignored, then every button must be let go, then four seconds to answer), and the `PAD HOT-PLUG WINDOW` shows a
prompt for six seconds. Answer nothing and they record "no answer" and "nothing happened".

`make hwtest-run` runs it headless, `make hwtest-diff` compares it with the pinned
emulator baseline, and `make hwtest-compare INPUT=<recording>` decodes a filmed
run and diffs it against the last silicon captures.

## Testing controllers and analog drift

Choose **CONTROLLER TEST (P1 + P2)** from the root menu. This is a friendly,
interactive diagnostic; the low-level serial-handshake measurement is part of the
linear run (SIO measurements below).

The controller test polls both front-panel ports every frame. Each side of the
screen reports the connected controller mode and keeps a complete button
history:

- **Yellow** means the button is held now.
- **Green** means the button has been observed at least once.
- **Grey** means it has not yet been tested.

An analog controller shows both stick positions and all four raw axis bytes.
Release both sticks and hold them still: after a short settling period the disc
samples 90 frames and reports the largest distance from the ideal centre byte
`128`. A maximum of 8 is green, 9-16 is a yellow warning, and anything above 16
is a red drift failure. Moving either stick automatically clears the old result
and starts a fresh measurement when the stick rests again. Digital controllers
remain fully testable and show `STICKS / DRIFT N/A` rather than inventing analog
data.

START is part of the button test, so it does not immediately leave this screen.
Hold **START+SELECT** together for roughly three quarters of a second on either
controller to return to the main menu.

> **The per-probe sections that follow describe the v1.x flow.** The screens they name
> (`PA2` to `PA5`, `Capturing timing data`, the console-tests page, the FMV and MDEC
> screens) no longer exist; their measurements are steps of the linear run, with the
> same record ids, and [hardware-test-v2-removed.md](hardware-test-v2-removed.md) says
> which step took which. They are kept because they explain what the records mean.

## Capturing and clearing stale BIOS reverb state (`PA5`)

PA5 is reachable from the main menu (TRIANGLE) and waits five seconds on a variant
selector (default
`DEPTH0`). PA4 SPLIT established that the real-console noise begins only when
the t0a0 map bank is uploaded, after SDK init and the light bank, with all
voice mixer volumes at zero. PA5 tests whether stale global reverb state is
reading the newly uploaded map data as its work buffer.

The probe captures SPUCNT/SPUSTAT, wet-output volumes, reverb base, external
input volumes, EON, a per-stage hash/nonzero count of all 32 reverb registers,
raw VBlank clocks, and map-bank readback. Crucially, `main()` snapshots the
untouched BIOS state before any SDK initialization; all 32 raw boot reverb
configuration words are included in the CRC-protected QR so the hardware state
can be replayed exactly in PSoXide.

Use Left/Right and Cross, and reboot the console between variants:

| Variant | Reset immediately before t0a0 map upload |
|---|---|
| `CONTROL` | No reverb changes; expected hardware noise reproduction |
| `DEPTH0` | Set only reverb output volume L/R to zero |
| `DEPTH2` | Set reverb output volume L/R to zero, then wait two VBlanks |
| `BASE0` | Set only the reverb work-area base to zero |
| `FULL0` | Zero wet volume, EON, external inputs, reverb routing/master, base, and all 32 config words |

Run DEPTH0 first. Then reboot and run CONTROL and FULL0. BASE0 and DEPTH2 are
follow-up discriminators. Keep OBS running from the calibration beep through
the final QR and note whether noise starts during stage 06 (`T0A0 MAP BANK
ONLY`). Decode the final payload with:

```sh
python3 tools/hwtest-audio-report.py /tmp/pa5-qr.txt
```

Press TRIANGLE from the completed PA5 screen to return to the menu.

### SCPH hardware result (2026-07-20)

The real-console `DEPTH0` capture isolated the fault. The retail BIOS handed
the executable a live full reverb preset (`SPUCNT=C085`, `SPUSTAT=0805`,
`vLOUT=5EBC/5EBC`, work-area base `E128`, `EON=00FFFFFF`, configuration hash
`F0417A52`). SDK initialization cleared reverb routing/master state but left
the wet-output depth, work-area base, and configuration registers intact. A
later map-bank DMA then replaced the data under that still-readable reverb work
area.

Setting only `vLOUT` to zero reduced the captured map-upload interval from the
PA4 SPLIT reproduction's `-30.07 dBFS` to `-86.82 dBFS`, a `56.75 dB`
suppression. The map-bank readback still matched (`25C971C5`) and the full
reverb register block remained otherwise unchanged. This proves that the noise
was stale BIOS reverb output, not a voice, CD audio, DMA corruption, or a bad
map-bank upload.

The historical firmware-boot regression recreated this measured handoff state.
External firmware boot was removed on 2026-09-15; the current built-in launch
path does not reproduce that firmware handoff. PSoXide's SPU continues reverb
reads, APF processing, and wet output while the reverb master-write bit is clear, matching the hardware probe; only feedback writes
are gated. The SDK now zeros both wet-output depth registers during `spu::init`,
before game banks can reuse SPU RAM. In the historical regression, the old PA5
executable reproduced the fault under CONTROL and was digitally silent under DEPTH0 in PSoXide, while a
newly linked Half-Life build remained digitally silent through its first eight
seconds under the same hostile handoff profile.

## Isolating the stale-menu-voice handoff (`PA4`)

PA4 is the second probe and waits five seconds on a variant selector (default SAFE2).
Its schema-v2 QR records the raw VBlank counter immediately before and after
each blocking transition, while the final stage retains the SPU RAM hashes.
Use Left/Right and Cross to start sooner. Reboot the console between variants:

| Variant | Transition under test |
|---|---|
| `BASELINE` | PA3 order: naturally ended voice 16, then init + 3050 + 3198 |
| `SAFE0` | Zero voice-16 volume and key it off immediately before the exact transition |
| `SAFE1` | Same explicit stop, then wait one hardware VBlank |
| `SAFE2` | Same explicit stop, then wait two hardware VBlanks |
| `SPLIT` | No pre-stop; observe separately after init, 3050, 3198, and readback |

Run SAFE2 first. If it stays quiet, reboot and capture SAFE0, then SAFE1 only
if SAFE0 is noisy. BASELINE is the PA3 reproduction and SPLIT identifies the
specific operation that starts the fault. Keep OBS running from the calibration
beep through the final QR for each run.

The menu marker starts 15 frames into stage 2 and naturally ends before frame
45, matching PA3. The selected shutdown and transition execute at frame 45.
Every blocking operation records actual elapsed VBlanks and realigns the engine
clock. The QR stores all 24 voices' nonzero-volume mask plus voice 16's complete
register state, ENDX, SPUCNT/SPUSTAT, bank dimensions, and readback hashes.

Decode each final `PA4/.../C:...` QR with:

```sh
python3 tools/hwtest-audio-report.py /tmp/pa4-qr.txt
```

Press TRIANGLE from the completed PA4 screen to return to the menu.

## Reproducing the Hazard Course bank transition (`PA3`)

PA3 remains as the second probe, an automatic six-stage reproduction of the
exact audio-bank lifecycle used when Hazard Course is selected. It uploads the
287,808-byte full menu bank (chunk 3000), starts a synthetic menu-accept sound
on voice 16, then executes the same `spu::init()` and replacement sequence as
the game: the 114,320-byte light profile (chunk 3050) followed by t0a0's
367,344-byte map bank (chunk 3198). The sample rates, decoded lengths, ADPCM
block counts, loop ownership, SPU addresses, and one-DMA-per-sample call shape
match hl-psx; all sound content is synthetic.

Stage 4 is a deliberate positive control: voices 0, 15, and 17 remain active
while their map bank is overwritten with loud marker data. It must sound bad.
Stage 5 recreates the same premise, silences and keys off every known map-bank
owner, then performs the same overwrite. It must become quiet apart from one
short completion marker. This proves the capture can distinguish a live-bank
overwrite from a safe handoff.

Every blocking upload records elapsed hardware VBlanks, then asks the engine to
discard fixed-update debt. Consequently, stage snapshots retain their intended
wall-clock position even when a real transfer spans several display frames.
The QR also stores ENDX, current envelope/start address for voices 0/15/16/17,
and a diagnostic 64-byte stable-mode SPU readback hash.

Record the complete run without changing capture volume. Leave the final QR
visible for several seconds, decode its `PA3/.../C:...` text, then run:

```sh
python3 tools/hwtest-audio-report.py /tmp/pa3-qr.txt
```

Press TRIANGLE from the completed PA3 screen to return to the menu.

## Capturing hl-psx voice-bank audio (`PA2`)

PA2 remains as the second automatic voice probe. Record the complete run
without changing the capture volume. Stage 0 emits a half-second
calibration marker. PA2 then reconstructs sanitized banks with the exact
Hazard Course resident/per-map sample counts, rates, block lengths, and upload
order: 68 core samples plus 26 map samples, roughly 508 KiB of back-to-back SPU
DMA traffic. PA2 used chunk 3051 rather than the first-map chunk 3050, so PA3
is the authoritative reproduction of the original recording's startup path.
No Half-Life audio is stored in either fixture.

Production upload and playback run first; a comparison upload that waits for
SPUSTAT's delayed transfer-mode mirror and gives the final FIFO words time to
drain runs second. In both cases voice 15's target contains a short marker,
then silence, and a proper one-shot end block. The following allocation is a
loud overrun guard. Hearing a late tone during either `END + GUARD` stage proves
that the target's end block did not stop the voice.

Leave the final QR visible for several seconds. Decode its `PA2/.../C:...` text
from any clear OBS frame and run:

```sh
python3 tools/hwtest-audio-report.py /tmp/pa2-qr.txt
```

The report preserves SPUCNT/SPUSTAT, all voice-15 registers, ENDX, maximum
mode/drain poll counts, and expected/observed last-64-byte hashes for all six
stages. SPU DMA readback is intentionally diagnostic rather than a pass/fail
oracle; compare its hash with ENDX and the external OBS waveform. Press Down
once from the completed PA2 screen to reach the older PA1 CD-route probe.

## Capturing timing data

1. Build and burn `build/examples/mipsel-sony-psx/release/hardware-tests.bin`
   with its matching `.cue`.
2. Let the controller-probe page settle, then press **Start** to jump directly
   to `TIMING MAP`.
3. Scan QR page `01/03`, press Right for `02/03`, then once more for `03/03`.
   Save or copy the complete `PX6/.../C:...` text returned by each scan.
4. If a value looks unstable, press Cross once to run five fresh samples and
   scan all three pages from the new run. Do not mix pages from different
   runs.

## Operator flow

The disc boots side-effect free into its main menu. Nothing measures or changes
hardware state until the operator chooses an entry:

   | Row | Contains |
   |---|---|
   | `RUN HARDWARE TEST` | The linear run. Row 0 is pinned: the headless rig fires CROSS at a fixed tick with the cursor at its boot position. Hold L2 as you press CROSS to skip the one step that can hang a console |
   | `CONTROLLER TEST (P1 + P2)` | Live two-port button, stick and analog-drift diagnostic |
   | `MEMORY CARD (AT OWN RISK)` | Card diagnostic behind a consent screen: it has had limited testing on real hardware and reads and writes the operator's card, so corruption cannot be ruled out. CIRCLE accepts the risk before any card traffic happens; writes additionally require the L1+R1+CROSS chord |
   | `VIEW LAST CAPTURE` | Back to the QR symbols the last run produced |

Up/Down moves, Cross runs, START backs out. During the run a progress screen
names the area, the step and the in-flight case or record (the record id is also
drawn as sixteen bit-cells under the bar, so a photo of a frozen screen names it).
When the run finishes the capture pages appear; Left/Right turn them, and they also
advance by themselves.

### Recording a capture

Start the recording before power-on and keep it going until the last QR page has been
on screen. Film the screen, not the TV's menu. Every page must be readable: the whole
payload is only valid complete, which `tools/hwtest-video-qr.py` checks with the
whole-binary CRC. The pages carry a run id and the tool groups pages by it, so a
recording that spans several runs is not combined into a payload that cannot check out.

There is no audio link any more. `AUDIO READOUT` is gone, so there is nothing to record
besides video.

Decode with one command:

    make hwtest-compare INPUT=~/Movies/run.mov

The run includes waits that are part of the measurement (the CD motor case waits up to
20 s), and the six-second hot-plug window; the progress bar covers all of it.

## Console tests (v1.27)

`MAIN MENU > CONSOLE TESTS (V1.27)` holds four cases. Each takes over the
display for its run, keeps its result up until CROSS, then opens the QR pages
with its records in the capture (records `2C0`-`2E3`, decoded by
`hwtest-report.py` as `console_*` rows). They are for filming: the answer is
on the screen, and the QR pages carry the numbers behind it.

**KERNEL TIMING (BIOS).** The SDK runtime replaces the BIOS exception vector,
so a normal run never executes a line of kernel. This case puts the vector the
BIOS left back (`main` snapshots it before the engine starts) and measures, in
system-clock cycles from root counter 2: EnterCriticalSection and
ExitCriticalSection one call at a time, with an empty call timed the same way
(`EMPTY CALL`) and subtracted into the `NET` column; then a VBlank round trip.
The round trip is the gap in a loop that reads the counter back to back: a
kernel event for VBlank is opened (class F2000003h, spec 2), only VBlank is
unmasked, and each interrupt shows as one read far later than the one before.
The runtime's own handler gets the same measurement (`VBLANK SDK`) as a
reference. The BIOS VBlank part runs last, three seconds after the earlier
results are shown, and may hang a kernel that does not acknowledge a VBlank
nobody handles: if the screen stops on `BIOS VBLANK NEXT`, that is the result
(power-cycle, and the other three cases are unaffected). The emulator's HLE
kernel answers the same case, so run it headless for the matching emulator
numbers; compare console and emulator on this case's own output.

**DISPLAY WIDTHS.** Steps through 256, 320, 368, 384, 512 and 640 pixels, five
seconds each (LEFT/RIGHT steps, START ends). The picture is a dark field with a
red bar on the extreme left pixels, a green bar on the extreme right, white
one-pixel lines on the outermost rows, one-pixel stripes beside each edge, grey
frames 8, 16 and 24 pixels in, and a ruler of ticks every 16 pixels and numbers
every 64. Read it off the screen: all of both bars visible and no black band
means the width is whole; a missing bar, or a ruler that starts at 64, is the
amount cropped; stripes that smear are a wrong dot clock. 256, 320, 512 and
640 go through `DisplayConfig`. It has no 368 or 384 preset, so those start
from the 320 `DisplayConfig` and write GP1(08h) with the 368-mode bit and
GP1(06h) from the 7-clock dot clock themselves; 384 pixels is that mode with a
wider window, an assumption the case tests (the emulator shows both as 368).

**480I INTERLACE.** A 640x480 interlaced picture through
`DisplayConfig::R640X480`: red on even lines and blue on odd on the left, white
line patterns at 1, 2 and 4 pixel pitch on the right. A display showing both
fields shows both colours (a flicker between them on a CRT); one showing a
single field shows one. The header reads GPUSTAT live (480-line and interlace
bits) and counts how often the field bit changed at VBlank (about once a frame
when interlace works).

**XA MUSIC LOOP.** Plays channel 0 of `HWSONGS.XA` (generated tones, 6 s) on
loop through `psx_io::cd::xa::Player`. The screen shows the state, the head
position, the loop count, the restart gap of each loop in milliseconds (the
time from the player restarting the song to the first poll that finds the head
back inside it, polling every few milliseconds) and a GETLOCP line: UPDATING
if the head position keeps changing, FROZEN OR SLOW otherwise, with the longest
time it sat still. If the song never loops, `NO LOOP SEEN` appears after its
length plus three seconds. The file comes from `make hardware-tests-disc`,
which needs `PSOXIDE_SDK` for the encode as `MOVIE.STR` does (the SDK at
ae6e1ef10 or later; it builds the file with `psx-audio-cook xa-encode`, four
tone songs as the channels of one 37.8 kHz stereo single-speed file) and puts
it on the disc after `MOVIE.STR` with `mkisopsx --xa-file`. A program
chain-loaded from another disc needs `HWSONGS.XA` in its own part of the image,
found by name.

## CD stream cases (v1.28)

Three more cases on the `CONSOLE TESTS` page, plus `CD STREAM, ALL THREE` that
runs them in turn. They exist for the SDK's streaming transport
(`psx-cdstream`, the interrupt-driven reader the streaming design in
[streaming-design-2026-10-08.md](streaming-design-2026-10-08.md) is built on),
which the characterisation capture never runs: its CD records read by polling.
Each installs the transport, measures, removes it and leaves records `2F0`-`2F7`,
`300`-`30B` and `310`-`315` in the capture (decoded by `hwtest-report.py` as
`cdstream_cost`, `cdstream_cdda` and `cdstream_motor` rows). Run them after the
full characterisation: the transport's exception wrapper stays in the vector
when it is removed, and the 20 s motor wait and the read after Stop are the
kind of thing that can leave the drive in a state the earlier records should not
inherit. All three read `CDTEST.BIN` (460 sectors of the `PSOXSTRM` pattern at
LBA 564) and check what they get against the pattern, so a layout that moved
shows as failed data.

**CD STREAM COST.** A sustained read at double speed (240 sectors) and at single
speed (120 sectors), three runs each. Sectors a second; the foreground CPU the
sector pops take (a fixed spin loop runs through the read and is compared with
the same loop run with nothing reading, so the difference is time the interrupt
handler took, in microseconds per sector and as a share of the CPU); the longest
handler call, from Timer 2; interrupts per sector; the time to the first sector
of a read that starts with a seek back from the run before; sectors discarded
and chained; the handler's private stack never touched.

**CD-DA HANDOFF.** How long a lease request takes to stop a read in flight
(four tries). Then, three times, the proper hand-off: the tone plays, a Pause
(its acknowledge and its completion are `T_pause`), GetlocP is saved, the
transport reads 64 sectors (time to the first and to the last), the tone is
resumed with SetLoc and Play from the saved position (time until the drive
reports PLAYING, and whether GetlocP two seconds later says it continued from
there rather than from the start of the track). Then two reads that start while
the tone is still playing, one with the transport's recovery Pause and one with
no Pause at all.

Whether CD-DA survives is read off the hardware, not heard. Before the read,
over a third of a second, three things are sampled: the drive's PLAYING status
bit, whether GetlocP's position advances, and the SPU's capture buffer for CD
input (SPU RAM 0 to 3FFh, the CD left channel after the CD volume), whose
peak-to-peak range is large while the tone reaches the SPU and zero otherwise.
During the read the capture buffer is sampled once a VBlank, giving the share of
samples that still carried signal and when the first silent one came. After the
read the three are sampled again. A third control read, after a proper Pause,
should show no signal at all. If the before-sample does not show signal in the
capture buffer (record `308`/`30A` flags, bit 2), the method is blind on that
console and the other two signals are the evidence. The emulator models the
capture buffer, so its numbers prove the suite runs and the pipeline decodes;
it has no laser, so they say nothing about a console.

**CD MOTOR.** A read after a Pause and a wait of 0, 5 and 15 seconds (does the
motor spin down on its own, and what does the next read cost); a read right
after a Stop (reported to fail on a console); and a read after a Stop once
GetStat says the motor stopped. The transport must read again afterwards.

What the suite already measured for the streaming design, so these cases do
not repeat it: seeks by distance forward and back (`90`-`93`, `C0`-`C7`), polled
read rate at 1x and 2x (`94`, `95`), command latencies including Pause (`96`-`9A`),
a read with and without live audio (`9B` against `9C`), the cost of starting the
tone (`9D`) and GetlocP during playback (`9E`). They use raw commands; the new
cases add the transport's own cost and the audio hand-off around it.

## Timing records move when the guest binary changes

Adding unrelated code shifts I-cache alignment, which genuinely changes measured
cycle counts. A rebuild therefore drifts the timing baseline even when no
measurement logic changed at all.

`make hwtest-verify-code` is what separates the two cases: it digests the
instructions between each probe's markers, so `drift=0` there while
`hwtest-diff` reports drift means the measured blocks are byte-identical and only
their addresses moved. That is a re-baseline, not a regression.

The mechanism, measured on 2026-09-17: a commit of clippy fixes that touched no
probe moved 104 of the 151 timing minima in the emulator, by up to 40 cycles
(`multu_mflo_small` 126 -> 151, `nop_block` 211 -> 196, `divu_mflo` 317 ->
302). Each record takes five samples, and between samples the scan heartbeat
and a pad poll run. That code shares I-cache lines with the probe (the image is
far larger than the 4 KiB direct-mapped cache), so every sample starts with a
few of its own lines evicted and pays a refill for each. How many depends on
where the linker placed both. The minimum across five samples does not escape
it because all five are equally cold. This is also the likely reason the two
full silicon captures disagree on `multu_mflo_small` (126 on v1.7, 140 on
v1.17) while agreeing on the medium and large bands.

Records `0x01`-`0x0F` therefore measure instruction cost plus a
layout-dependent refill tax, and they are not comparable across suite builds.
Their warm twins (next section) are.

## Performance probes (records `0x72`-`0x8D`, and `0xDC`-`0xEC` on request)

`src/perf_probes.rs`. These exist to price CPU-side optimisation techniques on
silicon and to calibrate the emulator's cycle model against numbers that do not
depend on link layout.

**The warm harness.** Every probe here runs its timed block twice inside one
assembly block and reports the second pass, and the block starts on a
cache-line boundary. Every line it executes is resident by the time it is
timed, so the result is a property of the instructions alone. In the emulator
these records have zero jitter where their older twins show 70-90 cycles.
`hwtest-report.py --layout-immune-timing-only` counts timing drift only for
these ids, which is the useful gate for a refactor that moves code.

| Id | Record | Question |
|---|---|---|
| `72`-`78` | warm twins of `01` nops, `02` ALU, `03` cached RAM load, `09` scratchpad load, `0B` RAM store, `0C` scratchpad store, `04` taken branch | what those instructions cost with no refill tax |
| `79`-`84` | `multu; k nops; mflo` x16 at the three `rs` magnitude bands, for k = 0 and k = m-1, m, m+1 around each band's documented latency m (6, 9, 13) | how many independent instructions fit behind a multiply before the `mflo` interlock stall is gone. Flat up to a knee, then +16 per extra nop; the knee is the real latency |
| `85`-`89` | `divu; k nops; mflo` x8 for k = 0, 34, 36, 38, 40 | the same for the divider (documented 36) |
| `8A` | `multu` with a small `rs` against a large `rt` | whether the band is chosen by `rs` alone |
| `8B` | signed `mult` with `rs` = -5 | whether a small negative `rs` takes the fast band |
| `8C`, `8D` | 32 alternating calls to two one-line leaves, exactly 4 KiB apart versus on neighbouring lines | the cost of a direct-mapped I-cache conflict per call. The wrapper runs through KSEG1 so it cannot disturb the lines it measures |

Emulator values at v1.21: the knees land exactly on the modelled latencies
(`7A`/`7B` = 126, `7C` = 142; `86`/`87` = 302, `88` = 318), and the alias pair
costs 1362 against 1036, about five cycles per conflicting call.

**The register A/B group** answers whether two undocumented-in-practice
registers buy anything:

* `RAM_SIZE` (`0x1F801060`) bit 7, which psx-spx describes as "delay on
  simultaneous CODE+DATA fetch from RAM". `DC`/`DD` run 64 RAM loads through
  their KSEG1 alias, so every instruction fetch is a RAM access coinciding with
  a RAM data access, with the bit as found and flipped. `DE`/`DF` are the same
  loads from KSEG0, warm, as the control pair.
* Cache control (`0xFFFE0130`) bits 13-17, which psx-spx labels only
  "supposedly" (read priority, no wait state, bus grant, load scheduling, no
  streaming). Each is flipped alone around 64 cached RAM loads and around a
  cold sweep of all 256 cache lines. `EA` sets the refill size to two words, a
  bit the emulator does model, as a cross-check that the flip and the restore
  both take effect. Bit 12 (interrupt polarity) has no performance reading and
  is left alone; bus grant runs last.

Each pair goes through byte-identical code: one assembly block reads the
register, makes an untimed call in the normal state, writes `value ^ mask`,
times the call, and restores, all reached through KSEG1 with interrupts masked.
Mask 0 is the control. No other code ever runs in the flipped state.

A wrong guess about one of these bits can hang a console, so the group never
runs in the standing battery or the headless conformance capture. It runs from
`TARGETED PROBES > PERF A/B (MAY HANG)`, which takes only the performance
probes (no CD, GPU, MDEC or SIO batteries, so a power cycle costs about a
minute) and then shows a full capture. The record id is on screen while each
record runs, so a hang names its bit. The emulator models none of these bits
except the refill size: headless, every flipped record equals its control, and
`make hwtest-capture-perf` only proves the path runs and restores. The numbers
come from a console.

The memory-control block now ends with the `RAM_SIZE` and cache-control values
(eleven registers instead of nine), so a capture records what the BIOS left in
both.

### v1.23: extended ids, GPU batches done properly, and the open shapes

Record ids are sixteen bits in the guest. `00`-`FE` travel as before; ids of
`100` and up go in a new PX8 block, `TIMING_EXT` (flag bit 6, last in the
payload: a u16 count, then id/min/median/max as four u16). The in-flight id is
drawn as sixteen cells during a scan.

`100`-`114`, GPU batches (`src/gpu_probes.rs`). The v1.22 console run showed
the fill battery's method is broken: it writes to GP0 unpaced, overflowing the
16-word FIFO, ends on GPUSTAT bit 26, which pulses between primitives, and
samples mostly transparent texels. These batches are a linked list of one
packet per primitive handed to DMA, ending in a GP0(1Fh) interrupt request,
which the GPU takes in order with the drawing; Timer 2 runs from the DMA kick
to GPUSTAT bit 24. Textures and CLUTs have no zero entry. Flat, Gouraud,
dithered, textured, raw, translucent and Gouraud-textured triangles; flat, 4bpp
and 8bpp rects; an 8bpp rect with a CLUT change on each; a texture page change
on each; a wide UV span; clipped-away triangles; a letterboxed batch; VRAM
fill and copy; and 64 two-pixel triangles of three kinds for setup cost. The
emulator has no draw-time model and reads about 20 for all of them. The
standing `A0`-`AF` records are unchanged and should not be trusted; the v1.22
sweep's `BA`-`BF`, `3B`, `38`, `CB` and `F6` are retired.

`120`-`136`, the shapes v1.22 left open: the multiply interlock at k = 1 to 4
and the divide at k = 35; a load followed by 2, 3, 6 and 8 independent
instructions; a store followed by 1 and 2, bursts of 2, 4 and 8 stores, and a
GP0 store followed by 3; RTPS followed at once by a read of SXY2, MAC0, MAC1
or IR1 and then 20 nops, with a control that reads after RTPS has finished
(22 cycles a turn if the read is free, about 36 if it waits); and the alias
pair called from a cached wrapper that cannot share a line with either leaf.

What the v1.22 captures found, and what went into the emulator, is in
[emulator-accuracy-from-silicon.md](emulator-accuracy-from-silicon.md).

### The performance sweep (v1.22)

`TARGETED PROBES > PERF SWEEP (SAFE)` runs the records above plus the ones
below and nothing else, then shows a full capture (four pages). `PERF A/B (MAY
HANG)` is the same sweep followed by the register A/B group. Neither runs the
conformance battery, so conformance cases read as pending in these captures.
The sweep exists because every record id from `00` to `FE` is now taken and the
standing battery's full capture was already at five pages.

| Id | Record | What it prices |
|---|---|---|
| `1E` | the warm nop block through KSEG1 | an instruction executed uncached, which is also what thrashing degenerates to |
| `37`, `39`, `C8`-`CA`, `CC`, `CD`, `CF` | byte and KSEG1 stores; loads with no nop between them; byte loads; `lwl`/`lwr` and `swl`/`swr` unaligned pairs; sixteen sequential addresses | the data-access shapes the compiler emits. The emulator charges an unaligned word 18 cycles against 8 aligned, and LLVM emits thousands of them |
| `1F`, `CE` | a store then three independent instructions (against `76`); a load then four (against `74`) | the four-entry write queue and LSI's load scheduling. Sony's notes and nugget's kernels say the store becomes free and the load hides part of its wait; the emulator has neither and reads both as purely additive |
| `27`-`2F` | warm latency of RTPS, RTPT, NCLIP, MVMVA, AVSZ3, SQR, OP, GPF, NCDS, issued back to back | the GTE's latency table, which until now had six cold, layout-dependent silicon points. Every GTE record carries 48 trailing nops (subtract them) so the timed pass starts with the GTE idle |
| `3A` | RTPT followed by the six `mtc2` that load the next triple (against `28`) | psx-spx's GTE pipeline page says inputs are latched within about four cycles and `mtc2` never stalls, so the next vertices can be loaded behind the current command |
| `ED`-`F2` | RTPT then 21/23/25 nops, RTPS then 13/15/17 nops, before the next command | how much CPU work fits behind a GTE command for free. Knee at the latency |
| `F3`-`F5` | sixteen `mtc2`, `ctc2`, `mfc2` | the coprocessor register moves every vertex pays for |
| `F7`, `F8` | one three-component Q12 lerp with `mult` and with GPF | the same work on each side, including the register traffic |
| `8E`, `8F` | sixteen `multu` with no read between them, then one `mflo` | whether a multiply issued behind a running one waits for it. The emulator says it costs nothing |
| `F9`-`FD` | GPUSTAT read, GP0 write (a GPU nop), I_STAT read, SPU halfword read and write | what an I/O port costs in an inner loop. The emulator has an SPU read at 27 cycles |
| `33`, `34` | the DMA controller walking 256 and 1024 empty packets | what an unused ordering-table slot costs per frame |
| `35`, `36` | 128 nops with GPU DMA idle, and started right after kicking a 512-node list | whether the CPU runs while the list is walked. Equal means it does |
| `9F`, `FE` | the same pair with 64 RAM loads in place of the nops | psx-spx and Sony both say the CPU runs during DMA only until it needs the bus. The emulator lets it run freely |
| `BA`-`BF` (with `A0`, `A2`, `AE`, `AF` retaken) | raw-texture and translucent textured triangles, Gouraud-textured triangles, triangles clipped away entirely, VRAM fill and VRAM copy | GPU cases the fill battery left out, each next to its reference |
| `3B`, `38` | 64 two-pixel triangles, flat-textured and Gouraud-textured | per-triangle setup with nothing to fill. nocash: 100 against 250 cycles |
| `CB` | `AF`'s 8bpp rects with a different CLUT on every other one | the CLUT cache reload. nocash: 256 cycles each |
| `F6` | `A2` with the vertical display range collapsed to one line | whether the GPU renders faster when it is not fetching the picture. The screen blanks for the few milliseconds this takes |
| `3C`, `3D` (A/B run) | `RAM_SIZE` bit 7 around a cold sweep of 4 KiB of code that also loads data | the realistic case for that bit: line refills and data reads contending for RAM |
| `3E`, `3F` (A/B run) | the SPU bus read-delay nibble as found and shortened, around 64 SPU status reads | whether SPU register traffic can be made cheaper. The emulator models this one: 3489 to 2229 |

Where these claims come from, and what the engine does about each today, is in
[ps1-performance-research-2026-09-17.md](ps1-performance-research-2026-09-17.md).

`make hwtest-diff-perf` gates the whole A/B capture headless against
`px8-emulator-perf-v<version>.txt`, counting timing drift only for warm
records, so it should survive unrelated guest edits.

**Folding a console capture back in.** For each finding, change the emulator in
the PSoXide-emulator repository and bump `components.lock.json` here; nothing
under `emu/crates/emulator-core` is editable in this tree.

1. Gap sweep knees: `mult_cycles` and `DIV_CYCLES` in `cpu.rs`. A knee one nop
   later than modelled means the latency is one cycle longer.
2. `8A`/`8B`: the `rs`-only, sign-folded magnitude rule in `mult_cycles`.
3. Warm twins: the RAM, scratchpad and branch costs in
   `bus/memory_timing.rs`, which were fitted to the layout-dependent records.
4. `8C` against `8D`: the refill cost per line in `icache_fill_stalls`.
5. `DD` against `DC`: if the uncached pair differs and the cached pair does
   not, `RAM_SIZE` bit 7 is real. Model it in the fetch path. Do NOT clear it
   at boot: psx-spx says that hangs CD loading on PU-8 boards.
6. Any cache-control pair that differs: model the bit, then measure the games.
7. GTE latencies and gap knees: the table in `psx-gte-core/src/state.rs`.
8. `8E`/`8F`: `hilo_busy_until` is overwritten by a second multiply today. If
   silicon queues them, that is a stall the emulator does not charge.
9. `36` against `35`, and `33`/`34`: linked-list DMA cost per node and whether
   it holds the CPU off the bus.
10. `BA`-`BF` and the fill battery: the GPU draw-time model, which does not
    exist yet. nocash's measured rendering timings are the prior.
11. `1F` and `CE`: the write queue and load scheduling, neither of which the
    emulator has. With a third of every Cortex vblank in RAM stalls, these
    two move whole-frame numbers more than anything else here.
12. `E2`-`EC`: LSI documents NOPAD, LDSCH and RDPRI, and the BIOS value has
    all three in their fast setting, so expect each flip to slow its workload
    rather than speed it up.

## Performance-lever gates (cases `0xC8`-`0xD2`, records `137`-`13A`, v1.24)

Three levers measured well headless and each rests on something only silicon
can answer. The cases sit near the end of the conformance battery (indices
200-210), so RUN ALL TESTS and FULL CHARACTERISATION both run them, and RESUME
FROM TEST at 200 runs these, the list-busy cases after them and the timing
scan. Code in `src/lever_probes.rs`. INFO values and passing observations travel only in the
FULL CHARACTERISATION capture; a conformance capture carries a case's numbers
only when it fails.

**GTE vs IRQ** (gates psx-rt's handler under any IRQ-heavy present path).
psx-rt's exception handler returns to EPC. psx-spx documents that an interrupt
taken on a GTE command lets the command run and leaves EPC pointing at it, so
returning to EPC runs it twice; its fix is to step EPC over a GTE command. The
emulator never takes an interrupt in front of a GTE command
(`should_take_interrupt`), so headless both variants are clean by construction.
The probe loops `mtc2` x3 to SXY0-2 (sentinels outside RTPS's output range),
RTPS, 20 nops, and reads SXY0: one RTPS leaves the old SXY1, two leave the old
SXY2, none leaves SXY0. Timer 2 interrupts at 331, 457, 613 and 797 clocks
(8192 iterations each) on top of VBlank, under a probe-owned handler that
acknowledges, counts the interrupts whose EPC held a GTE command, and returns
to EPC or EPC + 4.

| Case | Status | Expected | Observed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0xC8` return to EPC: exposure | INFO | interrupts taken | interrupts whose EPC held a GTE command |
| `0xC9` return to EPC: RTPS intact | PASS if none corrupted | interrupts on a GTE command | doubled (bits 0-15), lost or unrecognised (16-31) |
| `0xCA` skip GTE at EPC: exposure | INFO | interrupts taken | commands stepped over |
| `0xCB` skip GTE at EPC: RTPS intact | PASS if none corrupted | commands stepped over | as `0xC9` |

On silicon, `0xC9` failing with doubled close to its expected value says the
hazard is real at that rate; `0xCB` passing with a non-zero expected says the
fix works. `0xCB` failing with a non-zero high half says the command had not
run when the handler skipped it, i.e. the fix loses commands.

**Present queue** (gates quake-psx a29ca4d's `present-queue`). The prototype's
VBlank handler, copied instruction for instruction and chained to psx-rt's the
same way, runs 120 frames. Each frame's DMA chain sets its draw environment,
clears its buffer, draws 0 to 19 screen-sized Gouraud triangles (so some frames
outlast a VBlank and some edges find the GPU busy), a white bar that moves 16
pixels a frame, a marker, and ends in GP0(1Fh). Three instrumentation steps are
added to the handler: it counts edges, records GPUSTAT and Timer 1 when it
decides to flip, and acknowledges the GPU interrupt before the kick so each
chain's GP0(1Fh) raises GPUSTAT bit 24 afresh. A flip made while bit 24 is
clear exposes a frame the GPU has not finished: the tear this lever must not
cause.

| Case | Status | Expected | Observed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0xCC` frames kicked and drawn | PASS if all 120 kicked, no timeout, both markers read back | 120 | kicks (bits 0-15), timeouts (16-23), bad markers (24-31) |
| `0xCD` bit 28 idle means drawn | PASS if no early flip | flips checked (119) | flips made before the previous chain's GP0(1Fh) |
| `0xCE` flip lines after VBlank | INFO | largest Timer 1 value seen (lines a frame) | latest flip line (bits 0-15), earliest (16-31) |
| `0xCF` busy edges skipped | INFO | VBlank edges seen | edges that found the GPU or channel 2 busy |

Timer 1 runs from HBlank with sync mode 1 (reset at VBlank). `0xCE` is a
measurement: where that reset sits relative to the VBlank IRQ differs between
console models, and the emulator reads timers without catching them up (see
"Timers" in [emulator-accuracy-from-silicon.md](emulator-accuracy-from-silicon.md)),
so its value there is not a beam position. On silicon a spread of a few lines
between earliest and latest says every flip landed at the same beam position.
The moving bar is for the camera: a torn flip breaks it horizontally.

**Scratchpad stack** (gates the SDK's `ScratchpadStack`, PSoXide 3e939cd54).
The editor pins an SDK from before it, so psx-rt's trampoline is vendored
(`__hwtest_call_on_stack`, without the panic bookkeeping). hello-spstack's
workload (three call levels, each with an array in its frame, reading a
256-byte table in the scratchpad) runs 32 rounds on the RAM stack, then 32 on
a stack in scratchpad bytes 256-1024, each round after a different spin so the
interrupts land at different points. Throughout both runs: Timer 2 interrupts
every 1531 clocks plus VBlank (the GTE probe's handler, in skip mode; it uses
only `$k0`/`$k1`), and between rounds a 2048-node linked list re-kicked on
channel 2, a 4 KiB SPU upload re-kicked on channel 4 (sound RAM 0x60000), the
SDK's SectorReader streaming the CDTEST region, and a pad poll. CD data moves
by PIO, as SectorReader does since a1e95d30: chopping CD DMA on channel 3 can
latch busy for good on the project console, which would take the timing scan's
CD records with it, and no DMA channel can reach the scratchpad anyway.

| Case | Status | Expected | Observed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0xD0` checksum vs RAM stack | PASS if equal (and every round equal) | RAM-stack checksum | scratchpad-stack checksum |
| `0xD1` IRQs taken, all intact | PASS if no flag and at least 64 interrupts on the stack | 64 | interrupts taken with `$sp` in the scratchpad (bits 0-14), deepest stack use in bytes (15-26), flags (27-31: table changed, region bottom word changed, `$sp` not restored, caller's RAM frame changed, an interrupt saw the scratchpad during the RAM run) |
| `0xD2` background activity | INFO | 64 (rounds) | channel 2 kicks (bits 0-7), channel 4 kicks (8-15), CD sectors (16-23), pad polls (24-31), each saturating |

Records `137`-`13A` time one `level2` call (16 `level3` calls) with Timer 2,
inside the called function so both stacks run identical timed code: RAM stack,
scratchpad stack, then both again while channel 2 walks the 2048-node empty
list. Warm records `74`/`75` already price a bare RAM load against a
scratchpad one (514 against 126 for 64 on the v1.23 console sweep, about six
clocks a load). In the v1.24 build the timed call makes 515 stack loads and 899
stack stores (31 loads and 55 stores per `level3`, counted from the
disassembly, plus 19 of each in `level2`), so six clocks a load predicts about
3,100 clocks between `137` and `138`.

Emulator (frozen frontend, PSoXide-editor a03b8fa9): `137` 16,064, `138`
12,556, `139` 16,065, `13A` 12,517. The emulator does not model RAM loads
slowing during a linked-list DMA (record `FE`), so `139` equals `137` there;
silicon is expected to differ.

## Linked-list busy time (cases `0xD3`-`0xE9`, v1.24)

How long GPU DMA channel 2 stays busy (CHCR bit 24) on a linked list whose
nodes draw. The emulator's default model clears CHCR after a word-count
formula (`gpu_command_linked_cycles` in bus.rs: words + words/16 + 9 a node +
nodes/5 + 5) that ignores draw cost; the experimental FIFO model
(`PSOXIDE_EXPERIMENTAL_DMA_FIFO=1`) keeps it busy until the drawing nearly
drains. An hl-psx optimisation measures +21% on the default model and nothing
on the FIFO one, so which is true decides it. Code in `src/list_busy_probes.rs`;
indices 211-233, so RESUME FROM TEST at 211 runs only these and the timing
scan. The values are INFO and travel only in the FULL CHARACTERISATION capture;
`hwtest-report.py` prints them as a labelled `list_busy` table.

Four lists, each ending in GP0(1Fh), all drawing into the 320x240 area at
(0, 0) after a black fill that is fenced with its own GP0(1Fh):

| List | Nodes | Words (with headers) | Default-model CHCR formula |
|---|---|---|---|
| empty: 16 empty nodes | 17 | 18 | 181 |
| cheap: 16 two-pixel Gouraud triangles, one a node | 17 | 114 | 283 |
| expensive: the same packets, each triangle half the area | 17 | 114 | 283 |
| packed: the expensive triangles four to a node, 24 words each | 5 | 102 | 160 |

Cheap and expensive differ only in vertex coordinates, so the default model
gives them the same busy time. Every packet word's top byte is 0x00 or 0x30,
so if the GPU loses words from a packed node it can only misread them as NOPs,
cache clears or triangles, all clipped to the draw area.

Each list runs twice and the second run counts. From the kick, one poll loop
reads Timer 2 at the system clock, widened to 32 bits in software on every poll
so no list can overflow it, and stamps the first poll that sees each event; a
stamp is late by up to one poll turn, and 0xFFFFFFFF means never seen (after
16M clocks the loop gives up, the channel is aborted and GP1(01h) resets the
GPU). Bits 28 and 26 are stamped where their final high run begins, since both
pulse while the GPU works. Interrupts are masked for each walk.

| Case (index) | Status | Expected | Observed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0xD3`/`0xD7`/`0xDB`/`0xDF` (211/215/219/223) CHCR clear, empty/cheap/expensive/packed | INFO | words (bits 16-31), nodes (0-15) | clocks from the kick to CHCR bit 24 clear |
| `0xD4`/`0xD8`/`0xDC`/`0xE0` (212/216/220/224) GP0(1Fh) IRQ | INFO | as above | clocks to GPUSTAT bit 24 |
| `0xD5`/`0xD9`/`0xDD`/`0xE1` (213/217/221/225) GPUSTAT.28 settled | INFO | as above | clocks to the start of bit 28's final high run |
| `0xD6`/`0xDA`/`0xDE`/`0xE2` (214/218/222/226) GPUSTAT.26 settled | INFO | as above | the same for bit 26 |
| `0xE3` (227) packed list draws the same pixels | PASS if the packed list's GP0(1Fh) arrived and twelve sampled pixel pairs hash the same as after the expensive list | hash after expensive | hash after packed |
| `0xE4`/`0xE6`/`0xE8` (228/230/232) CPU during walk: ALU / RAM load / scratchpad iterations | INFO | 256 | iterations while the expensive list walked (bits 0-15), clocks for 256 iterations idle (16-31), each saturating |
| `0xE5`/`0xE7`/`0xE9` (229/231/233) the same loops' walk clocks | INFO | iterations | clocks from just after the kick to CHCR clear |

The throughput loop is one assembly block: eight `addiu`, eight RAM `lw` or
eight scratchpad `lw`, then a read of channel 2's CHCR and one of Timer 2,
until CHCR bit 24 clears. Run idle, CHCR is XORed with bit 24 so the exit test
never passes and the same instructions run 256 times. Slowdown during the walk
is (walk clocks / walk iterations) / (idle clocks / 256).

Emulator, frozen frontend `baseline-2026-09-22`, full characterisation capture
(clocks):

| | default model | FIFO model |
|---|---|---|
| empty: CHCR / 1Fh / bit 28 / bit 26 | 225 / 6 / 6 / 6 | 226 / 226 / 6 / 6 |
| cheap | 283 / 6 / 4,906 / 4,906 | 4,648 / 4,937 / 4,937 / 4,937 |
| expensive | 283 / 6 / 314,366 / 314,366 | 293,588 / 313,187 / 313,187 / 313,187 |
| packed | 159 / 19 / 314,331 / 314,331 | 234,905 / never / 234,905 / 234,905 |
| `0xE3` packed pixels | PASS | FAIL (the GP0(1Fh) was lost) |
| ALU loop: walk iterations / walk clocks / idle per 256 | 9 / 217 / 6,392 | 10,719 / 267,967 / 6,392 |
| RAM loads | 4 / 292 / 18,941 | 3,987 / 294,917 / 18,932 |
| scratchpad loads | 9 / 217 / 6,392 | 10,719 / 267,967 / 6,392 |

The two models answer differently exactly where the lever cares: default
gives cheap and expensive the same CHCR time and raises the 1Fh interrupt a
few clocks after the kick, long before the drawing it follows (bits 28 and 26
do track the drawing there); FIFO keeps CHCR busy for most of the drawing, and
drops words from a 24-word node while the GPU draws. Neither slows the CPU
during the walk (FIFO: 25.0 clocks an ALU iteration against 25.0 idle, 74.0 a
RAM iteration against 73.9), where the v1.22 console read RAM loads half again
as slow during an empty-list walk (`FE`).

Reading a console capture: `219` near `215` means the default model is right
about CHCR; `219` near `220` and far above `215` means the FIFO model is, and
the +21% does not exist on silicon. `220` is the console's time to draw the
expensive list. `221` against `220` says whether GPUSTAT bit 28 going idle
means the drawing has finished, which the present-queue gate (`0xCD`) relies
on. `227` failing, or `224` reading never, says silicon loses words from a node
larger than its FIFO while it draws, and `223` then times some other workload.

## FMV stream test (MAIN MENU last row, records `1F0`-`1F5`, v1.25)

The SDK's FMV console test (`sdk/examples/hello-fmv`, run as a library; the
suite's side is `src/fmv_test.rs`). The disc carries `MOVIE.STR` at LBA 1024:
75 s of synthetic 320x240 15 fps video at the full double-speed sector budget
with interleaved XA-ADPCM stereo beeps (440 Hz left, 660 Hz right, one a
second), built by the SDK's `tools/fmv_test_movie.py` (FFmpeg and psxavenc;
`make hardware-tests-disc` builds it once into `build/`, `PSXAVENC=` names the
encoder). Every video sector carries its ordinal, the file's total and a
checksum, and the player streams all 9,826 of them through the SDK's polled
PIO path.

An overlay over the video counts frames shown (FR), frames skipped because the
decoder was still busy (LATE), sectors that never arrived (LOST) and sectors
that arrived corrupt, repeated or out of order (BAD), with the LBA and the
time. The summary screen stays up until CROSS or START returns to the menu,
whose row then shows PASS or FAIL.

**PASS** means every video sector arrived intact (SECT 9826/9826), LOST 0, BAD
0, DROP 0, CDERR 0 and DECERR 0. LATE and the KCYC line are measurements, not
pass criteria. LATE is higher here than on the standalone FMV disc (headless,
same emulator: SHW 741 / LATE 382 against 889 / 234) because the bitstream
decode costs more per frame inside this program (KCYC VLC 1375 against 1222; it
moves with code layout, and this suite builds without the SDK's delay-slot
filler flags); the sectors, and so the verdict, do not depend on it.

The result joins the capture as six timing-block records whose three fields
are counters, not min/median/max: `1F0` pass, good, total; `1F1` lost, bad,
dropped; `1F2` drive errors, decode errors, first problem LBA (FFFF none);
`1F3` shown, late, VBlanks; `1F4` kilocycles per frame for the bitstream, MDEC
plus upload, and waiting; `1F5` last good LBA, run count, setup failure code.
`hwtest-report.py` prints them as an `fmv` table and re-derives the verdict
from the counters. A capture taken before the run is re-encoded with them at
once (and so carries the timing block even if it was a routine one); a capture
taken after it picks them up from its own timing scan. Run it after FULL
CHARACTERISATION, so the characterisation still describes a console nothing
has touched: the player resets the SPU and reprograms the drive.

The movie moves the CD-DA track outward by 11,230 sectors. No probe names an
LBA past the CDTEST region, but `0x9B` (a read at LBA 424 while track 2 plays)
now starts from further away, so it is not comparable with v1.24's.

## CD-DA contention (records `0x9B`-`0x9E`)

The disc carries a synthetic CD-DA track (track 2, generated by
`tools/gen-cdda-tone.py`, 440 Hz left / 660 Hz right) specifically so
read-while-audio contention can be measured. This is the one CD failure no
emulator reproduces, and it cannot be probed without a real audio track, which
is why the track is part of the disc build rather than optional.

`0x9B` against `0x9C` is the whole measurement: the same read path, the same
sector count, the only difference being whether audio was live. The emulator
reports 6731 against 6730 HBlank ticks, i.e. **no contention at all**. Distinct
channel frequencies mean the same recording also proves stereo routing and lets
a dropout be heard, not just measured.

## GPU fill rate (records `0xA0`-`0xAF`)

The emulator models no GPU draw time whatsoever, so there is no data anywhere to
build a model from and the console is the only possible instrument. Pixel counts
are held identical across shading modes, so a difference isolates interpolation,
blending or dither cost rather than the per-pixel floor. `0xAA` against `0xAB`
holds total pixels constant while changing primitive count, separating setup
cost from fill cost. `0xAC` against `0xAD` holds pixels constant while changing
UV footprint, which is the texture-cache probe.

Current emulator readings show gouraud within 1% of flat and dithered identical
to undithered, and `0xAC`/`0xAD` identical, all consistent with none of these
costs being modelled. Every one is a claim console data will settle.

Everything draws into off-screen VRAM at y >= 400, so neither the photographed
capture nor the QR pages are disturbed. Sizes stay well under one Timer 2 wrap
(65,535 cycles): at roughly a pixel per cycle a 256x256 fill would sit on the
boundary and alias a slow result into a fast one.

## MDEC (records `0xB0`-`0xB3`)

Table uploads and reset settle. Two gotchas cost real debugging time and are
worth recording: **busy is status bit 29, not bit 31** (bit 31 is the data-out
FIFO flag and stays set while idle, so polling it never returns), and a command
holds busy until it has consumed *exactly* the number of payload words it
implies (16 for luma-only quant, 32 for luma+chroma, 32 for scale).

Decode-to-drained is measured for one and two macroblocks (`0xB4`, `0xB5`),
using minimal but valid blocks: a head halfword carrying quant scale and a
signed 10-bit DC, then `0xFE00`, whose run-length field of 63 overflows the
coefficient index and terminates the block.

Draining is part of the measurement, not overhead. It is also where the two
platforms disagree, so the wait accepts **either** termination: real hardware
clears busy once the decode finishes and its output is read, whereas PSoXide
only re-evaluates busy when the last parameter word arrives (output is already
queued by then), so busy stays set forever and a busy-only wait never returns.
Draining the expected pixel count terminates in emulation; the busy check
terminates, sooner, on silicon.

## SIO / pad (records `0xB6`-`0xB9`)

The same pad poll at four setup/inter-byte pacings. The spread is the signal: it
shows how much of a transfer is fixed cost and how much is pacing the pad
demands. The SCPH-1200 setup-delay hunt cost a whole session; this makes it a
standing measurement. `0xFFFF` means the pad did not answer, which is distinct
from a fast poll.

## SIO measurements (v2.0, records `0x600`-`0x6A6`)

Added so that what the emulator cannot settle becomes a number in the capture. None
of these passes or fails; every one is laid out the same whether a pad, a card or
nothing is plugged in (a port with nothing in it is a result). The guest is
`src/sio_timing.rs` (raw register measurements) and `src/pad_engine.rs` (the
SDK's interrupt-driven pad engine, `psx_pad::console`, opt-in per game; its design is
`sdk/docs/PAD-IRQ-ENGINE.md` in the SDK). Times are system-clock cycles (33.8688 MHz)
from Timer 2 unless a field says HBlanks (Timer 1). The memory card is read, and written only where a record below says so.
The field names of every record are in `tools/hwtest-report.py` (`V2_RECORDS`) and are
decoded as rows `v2,<id>_<name>,<field>,<value>`.

Raw port measurements, steps `SIO0 SELECT DELAY`, `SIO0 PAD ACK TIMING`,
`SIO0 CARD ACK TIMING`:

* `600`-`601`, select to first byte, port 1 then 2: 16 delays from 0 to 24,576 cycles
  after `/CS` is asserted, four polls each; a poll counts when the first two bytes
  pulsed `/ACK` and the third reply is `0x5A`. Fields: the shortest delay at which
  all four polls were answered, the longest delay at which any failed, and a 16-bit
  mask of the delays that were fully answered (bit n is delay n). This is the
  question the official SCPH-1200 raised, in cycles instead of status-read spins; the
  older sweep is `D0`-`DB`.
* `610`-`618` (port 1) and `620`-`628` (port 2), one record per byte of a nine-byte
  `0x42` pad poll: cycles from the byte's write to `/ACK` asserting, the pulse width,
  and the cycles until the byte was received. Median of eight polls. A byte that gets
  no `/ACK` (an empty port, or the last byte of a short reply) reads `0xFFFF`.
  `630`-`631` hold what each port answered (replies 0 to 3 and a flag word: bits 0-8
  which bytes pulsed `/ACK`, bit 9 the third reply was `0x5A`, bit 10 the `STAT` IRQ
  latch after the release, bit 11 TX idle).
* `6C0`-`6C3` and `6C8`-`6CB`, the same for the four bytes of a memory-card read
  command (`81 52 00 00`, abandoned before any data moves); `634`-`635` hold the answers.
* Empty-port behaviour is those same records on a port with nothing in it:
  replies `0xFF`, no `/ACK`, the byte still received after its eight clocks.

`PAD AND CARD UNDER LOAD`: `640`-`64F`, port 1 idle, port 1 loaded, port 2 idle, port 2
loaded, three records each. A pad poll and a card frame read take turns, 24 rounds. Loaded
means the GPU walking a list of large triangles behind them, with interrupts on. Records:
pad polls and card reads that worked, with error counts; card frame time in HBlanks
(min, median, max); pad poll time in cycles. A slot with no card gets rows of
`0xFFFF`.

Pad engine, steps `ENGINE SETUP SWEEP`, `ENGINE ACK PACING`, `ENGINE TIMED PACING`,
`ENGINE AND CARD LEASE`, `ENGINE UNDER LOAD`, `PAD HOT-PLUG WINDOW`:

* `660`-`666`: the engine's own select-to-first-byte path (a timer interrupt starts the
  first byte), swept over 2,000 to 8,000 cycles in steps of 1,000, 100 frames each:
  clean updates on port 1, faults, and each port's health.
* `670`-`674` with `Ack` pacing and `678`-`67C` with `Timed` pacing, 600 frames each
  with the pad asked into analog mode: updates, faults and health per port; interrupts,
  stalls and spurious interrupts; the CPU a loop keeps (work per frame against the same
  loop with nothing polling, so the engine's cost, and with port 2 as it is, empty or not,
  its cost); mode changes seen on port 1 (a wrong identifier or a slipped packet shows
  here), kicks, and the final mode. This answers whether the engine's one control-register
  write between bytes corrupts a given pad, the question the 2026-06-22 result left open.
* `690`-`693`: 600 frames of the engine with a memory-card sector read every ten frames
  through `lease()`, on the first slot that holds a card: pad faults, frames the engine
  skipped while the port was out, card checksum errors; reads ok and tried; the wait for
  the lease (median, longest); card frame time in HBlanks. Reads only, unless L1 and R1 are held
  while CROSS starts the run, as the card diagnostic asks for its writes: then every frame read is
  also written back with the bytes just read (the card's contents do not change), and `694` holds
  the writes ok and tried and the write time in HBlanks.
* `720`-`749`, the engine under load: seven phases of six records each (loop rounds per
  frame; faults, stalls and spurious interrupts; handler stack left, events and kicks; the
  load generator's own interrupt state; `I_MASK` and `I_STAT`; totals since install). Phases:
  the engine with no ports polled under the whole load (control), both ports alone, then with
  the GPU list walk, the SPU upload and the CD sector stream one at a time, then CD with the
  pad interrupts re-opened, then all three with them open. The load runs in the foreground with
  interrupts enabled and every call is timed: the longest call, how many outlast a pad byte on
  the wire (1,100 cycles), and how many began with interrupts disabled or with a pad or
  engine-timer interrupt already pending. The finding in the emulator: the SDK's
  `SectorReader` sets `I_MASK` to VBlank only while it runs, which switches off the engine's
  SIO and root-counter-0 interrupts; with that mask the engine stalls and faults on half the
  frames (phase 4), with the two bits re-opened it does not (phases 5 and 6). The probe is not
  the cause: it never masks interrupts, and no load call began with them off.
* `638`-`63B`, hot-plug: a six-second window with a prompt ("UNPLUG+REPLUG ONE (OPTIONAL)" and
  the seconds left), both ports watched through the engine every frame: transitions, the health
  before and after, frames the port read absent, and the frames of the first and last change.
  Unplug and replug a pad in either port while the prompt is up, or do nothing.

### DualShock motors (records `760`-`768`)

Step `DUALSHOCK MOTORS`, at the end of the SIO area before the hot-plug window (`src/rumble.rs`;
the objective part is written out as packets, the operator part uses the SDK's motor API). For
each port, every packet a frame after the last: a plain poll for the
identifier; config-mode entry (`01 43 00 01`) and an `01 45` query to see whether the pad now
answers `F3`; the motor mapping (`01 4D 00 00 01 FF FF FF FF`, which returns the old mapping);
config-mode exit (`01 43 00 00 5A...`); then a poll with both motors commanded and one with them
stopped. A digital pad, or an empty port, must not answer `F3` and must come out unchanged; an
analog pad in digital mode is expected to accept. Records per port: `760`/`763` identifiers and
a flag word (bit 0 the entry answered `5A`, 1 config mode confirmed, 2 and 3 the mapping answered
`5A` and `F3`, 4 the exit answered `F3`, 5 and 6 the motor poll kept the identifier and `5A`,
7 no pad, 8 the query answered `5A`); `761`/`764` the old mapping bytes; `762`/`765` the motor
poll's identifier, `5A` and buttons, and the identifier after the stop; `767`/`768` the cost of a
poll with the motors idle and with both on, in cycles from the first byte written to the last byte
received (median of eight; v2.2 and earlier recorded the last byte's unanswered window instead).

v2.2 adds, per port: `76D`/`76E` the pad identity (a plain poll's id and `5A`, button bytes and
stick bytes) and the same on the screen for a second and a half; Enter Config tried up to four
times a frame apart, with the last attempt's reply bytes 1 to 8 in `769`/`76B` and `76A`/`76C`
(the second also holds the attempts made and the first attempt's id and `5A`); the `01 45`
query's reply bytes 3 to 8 in `76F`/`770`, which carry the model, mode and LED bytes when the pad
is in config mode and `FF` when not.

Operator part, on the first port that accepted the config packets (`766`): the small motor on for
a second, the large motor at 0, 64, 128, 192 and 255 for a second each, and a series of pulses of
1, 2, 4, 8 and 15 frames on each motor, asking after each "FELT? X YES O NO" (CROSS yes, CIRCLE
no; the question shows for a second with the pad ignored, then every button must be let go, then
four seconds to answer; no answer is its own value). The record packs two bits per stimulus,
in that order (0 none, 1 yes, 2 no), the number asked, and the port. v2.3 adds `771`-`773` (the raw
button word of each answer, then a mask of questions whose buttons were never let go) and
`774`-`776` (the frame each answer arrived on, then a mask of questions that saw a button down in
the first second). Every motor is stopped with
several polls of zeros before the step ends. With no pad that takes the config packets the
record reads `FFFF` and nothing is asked.

## Other v2.0 measurements

* `GTE COMMAND LATENCY` (`150`-`191`, `192`-`195`): for each of 22 GTE commands, three
  records: the command then an immediate `mfc2` of MAC0, the same of MAC1, and the command
  back to back with itself; the cycles for eight or sixteen turns (the `work` of the
  record). If a coprocessor read waits for the command the first two cost the command's
  latency a turn; otherwise two instructions. `192`-`195` are `swc2` (a store of a
  coprocessor register) straight after RTPS (MAC1 and SXY2), NCLIP (MAC0) and SQR (MAC1),
  the interlock the emulator models for SWC2 without a console figure behind it.
* `DMA VERSUS CPU LOADS` (`140`-`145`): 64 RAM loads with a DMA channel idle and the same
  loads straight after kicking a transfer big enough to outlast them, for the SPU
  (256 words), the ordering-table clear (2,048 words) and a block transfer of NOP words to
  GP0. The GPU list walk is `35`, `36`, `9F`, `FE`.
* `TIMER 1 HBLANK RATE` (`650`-`652`): Timer 1 on the HBlank clock over 120 frames, once
  with nobody reading the counter and once with the CPU reading it in a tight loop:
  counts per window, distinct values seen, the largest step between reads, and how many
  reads the loop made. Does tight polling change what it counts?
* The emulator timing audit's measurement list, `TIMING-AUDIT-STEPS.md` (M1 to M11), warm
  harness unless noted: the block twice, the second pass timed on Timer 2 at the system clock,
  interrupts masked, five samples (min, median, max):
  * M1 GTE early reads, copies of `130` (RTPS, the read, 20 nops, sixteen turns): `swc2 $14` to
    the scratchpad (`192`), `cfc2 $31` (`193`), `lwc2 $0` from the scratchpad (`194`). Interlocked
    is `130`'s 638; free is about 400. M2: the same `swc2` to cached RAM (`195`).
  * M3 MMIO read cost, 64 x (lw, nop), timed by a counter other than the one read: Timer 0
    counter, DMA channel 2 CHCR and DPCR timed by Timer 2 (`1A0`-`1A2`); Timer 2's counter timed
    by Timer 0 on the system clock (`1A3`).
  * M4 scratchpad `lb`, `lbu`, `lh`, `lhu`, `sb`, `sh`, 64 each with a nop (`1A8`-`1AD`).
  * M5 isolated cache: 64 `sw` and 64 `lw` run through KSEG1 with Status.IsC clear against the
    scratchpad (the control, `1B0`, `1B1`), set (`1B2`, `1B3`), and set with the cache-control
    TAG bit as well (`1B4`, `1B5`). The Status read-modify-write is in all six; the epilogue is the
    BIOS's flush (IsC, TAG, a zero word to all 256 lines).
  * M6 CPU/DMA matrix, loops of 64, idle against channel running: GPU 512-node empty list walk
    with 64 `sw` back to back (`1E0` idle, `1E1` during), `sw` + 3 nops (`1E2`, `1E3`), `lw` + 3
    nops (`1E4`, `1E5`), scratchpad `lw` + nop (`1E6`, `1E7`), `lw` + nop (`9F`, `FE`); OTC channel
    6, 1024 words, `lw` + nop (`142`, `143`); SPU channel 4, 512 halfwords (`140`, `141`); GPU
    block channel (`144`, `145`). The idle references are `76`, `1F`, `74`, `75`. The CD and MDEC
    rows need the far end really there, so they are field records, `700`-`709`: loop clocks idle,
    loop clocks during, and the transfer's own duration in units of 32 clocks, with every wait
    bounded (about 2 million clocks) and `FFFF` for a timeout. CD (`700`-`707`): SetMode (1x or
    2x, 2048 or 2340 bytes), SetLoc to the test region, ReadN, wait for INT1 so a sector is
    buffered, BFRD, DMA 3 to RAM under the loop; `lw` loop then `sw` loop for each of the four
    combinations. MDEC (`708`, `709`): reset, tables, a decode command for four macroblocks, DMA 1
    started to drain, DMA 0 kicked to feed under the loop. Step `CD DMA VERSUS CPU` is in the
    drive area, ahead of `CD MOTOR`.
  * M7 controlled-cold code: the 4 KiB evictor `1C` uses before every sample, then (a) 64 `sw` to
    RAM, (b) 64 `sw` to the scratchpad, (c) 32 x (lw GPUSTAT, nop), (d) 32 x (lw RAM, nop), (e) 64
    nops (`1B8`-`1BC`); one pass, nothing warmed.
  * M8 warm BIOS ROM (`1C0`-`1C3`), EXP1 (`1C4`-`1C7`) and EXP3 (`1C8`-`1CB`), through KSEG1: 64 x
    (lw, nop), 64 bare `lw`, then `lhu` and `lbu` with a nop.
  * M9 GPU texture state, `200`-`223`: a list of 16 textured triangles at 8x8, 16x32 and 32x32,
    at 4, 8 and 15 bits a texel, each (a) one page and one CLUT, (b) alternating page, (c)
    alternating CLUT, (d) one page with the UV window moving. Clocks for the list (divide by 16).
    Anchors `10C` and `10B`. 15 bpp has no CLUT, so (c) repeats (a) there.
  * M10 multiply/divide unit: `divu`, `multu` (small), a gap of 0, 10, 30 or 36 nops, `mflo`
    (`1D0`-`1D3`) against `divu` and 36 nops (`1D4`); `multu` large, `mtlo`, `mflo` (`1D5`, small
    operand `1D8`); `multu`, `mthi`, `mfhi` (small `1D6`, large `1D7`).
  * M11 polled-counter tick loss, `6B0`-`6B7` (step `POLLED TIMER TICK LOSS`): an assembly loop
    reads the counter and adds the 16-bit steps it sees until about a second of ticks is
    reached, with Timer 1 on HBlank free-running as the reference, read at the two ends only.
    Loops of 6 and 14 instructions, for Timer 2 and Timer 0 on the system clock, Timer 2 at an
    eighth and Timer 0 on the dot clock. Record: reference HBlanks, ticks seen in thousands,
    ticks per HBlank times 16; the lost fraction is one minus ticks per HBlank over the nominal
    rate (2,172 system clocks to a line in the audit's figure). Deviations from the audit's
    wording: about one second rather than a second and a half, so Timer 1 (65,536 lines is 4.2 s)
    cannot wrap when a counter loses most of its ticks; Timer 1 is the reference for every case,
    because Timer 0 on the system clock wraps in 1.9 ms and cannot count a second from its two
    ends. `650`-`652` do the same for Timer 1 itself, free against polled.
* The scratchpad-versus-RAM load and store cycles, the I-cache miss cost and the
  multiply and divide latencies already measured are the records that existed before
  (`72`-`8D`, `C8`, `C9`, `1C`-`1D`, `42`-`45`); this version does not repeat them.

## Console identity and raster hashes (precision `128`-`159`)

A capture that cannot say which console and BIOS produced it is much harder to
trust later, and previously that was encoded only in a hand-written filename.
Two BIOS regions are sampled (build date at `0x100`, version string at
`0x7FF32`) as a deliberate hedge: these reads return zero on the emulator's
side-loaded HLE path, which maps no BIOS ROM, so they **cannot be validated
before a burn**. If one region reads zero on console the other still identifies
the machine.

Then 22 bit-exact raster hashes. A 32-bit hash covers a whole 96x96 VRAM region,
making this the cheapest coverage per payload byte in the schema, and it is what
originally caught the triangle rasterizer being Redux-shaped rather than
silicon. Timing says how long a primitive took; only a hash says it drew the
right pixels. `raster_hash_00` currently reads `0x04121005`, matching the
recorded silicon hash the emulator's own rasterizer test asserts.

## CD-ROM battery (records `0x90`-`0x9A`)

The drive is the one subsystem where the console is the only usable
instrument: seek time is mechanical and no emulator models head travel.

Every record here is timed on **Timer 1's HBlank clock** (~63.9 us per tick,
~4.19 s of range), not Timer 2's system clock, which wraps after ~1.9 ms and
could not express a seek at all. Seek and read acknowledge immediately and
finish much later, so these wait for the drive's SECOND response (the
completion IRQ) via `cdrom::try_command_until_complete`. Timing to the ack
would report a mechanical seek as microseconds.

| ID | Measurement |
|---:|---|
| `90`-`93` | SeekL over 1, 16, 128 and 512 sectors from a parked origin |
| `94`-`95` | 8 sequential sectors, single and double speed |
| `96`-`98` | GetStat, SetMode and GetLocP response |
| `99`-`9A` | Pause and Init, to completion |

Each seek re-parks the head first, so a record measures a known distance
rather than travel from wherever the previous record happened to finish.
Throughput discards the first sector, which carries the seek and spin-up
settle, and so reports sustained rate rather than first-byte latency.
`0xFFFF` means the command did not complete within its poll budget, which is
distinct from a zero-time result.

The emulator currently reports the same 845 HBlank ticks for a 128-sector and
a 512-sector seek, so its seek time is distance-independent. Single and double
speed differ by exactly 2.0x. Both are exactly the kind of claim a console
capture can confirm or demolish.

## Payload schema `PX8`

PX8 supersedes PX7: every block after the header is optional, behind a flags
byte, and pages are counted from the payload rather than fixed per schema.

PX7 always carried everything. Timing envelopes and precision values are 71% of
that payload and they are *characterisation*: there is no expected value to
check them against, silicon is the reference. A routine run does not need them,
and as the suite grows towards covering every chip, shipping them on every
capture is what limits how many cases can be added.

So a **conformance** capture carries the status bitmap and one record per
FAILING case -- 163 bytes and a single QR at 200 cases, and still one QR at a
thousand, because a passing case costs three bits and nothing else. A
**characterisation** capture carries the lot, in PX7's field order, so an
archived `px7-*` reference still describes the same thing a full PX8 does.

A failure record names its case by `TestSpec::id`, not by array position, so a
capture archived today still points at the same test after the array grows. The
ids are checked for uniqueness at compile time.

PX7 itself superseded PX6: four pages instead of three, a median column beside
each min/max, explicit per-record ids, and 128 record slots. Since v1.21 a PX8
timing block carries only the records that ran, and the header count says how
many that is; unfilled slots used to cost seven bytes each on the wire.

The median is not decoration. With five samples reduced to two numbers, a
min/max gap cannot distinguish one stray interrupt from a genuinely bimodal
distribution. Records now routinely read `min=126, median=126, max=286`, which
says plainly that the maximum is a single cold-I-cache outlier and the typical
cost is the minimum.

Samples are now taken with **interrupts masked** (`IrqGuard`, restored on
drop). Previously the only defence against a VBlank or CD IRQ landing inside a
measured window was that one of the five repeats happened to escape it, so the
min/max gap reported "did an interrupt hit" rather than silicon jitter.

Record ids are written into the payload rather than implied by position, so an
unused slot is skippable and adding a probe cannot silently shift the meaning
of every later record. `0xFF` marks an unfilled slot; `0x00` could not, being
the real empty-harness record.

Note that two work sizes per probe were considered and rejected: every probe
shares the identical harness prologue and epilogue with record `0x00`, so
`(t_probe - t_empty) / N` already cancels the harness exactly.

## Payload schema `PX6` (superseded)

The capture is a 1,733-byte versioned binary record encoded as exactly 2,312
Base64 characters. Its three pages carry 828, 828, and 656 characters. Each
screen encodes its complete `PX6/<page>/<chunk>/C:<crc>` text in the proven
Version-20-L QR geometry. A CRC-32 protects each page and a second CRC-32
protects the reconstructed binary record.

The record preserves all 173 conformance observations and their statuses, all
90 timing min/max pairs, CPU/GTE/SPU startup-scan summaries, the nine
memory-control registers, run IDs, section digests, and 128 raw precision
values. Fixed schema ordering avoids repeating labels and IDs on screen.
`tools/hwtest-report.py` accepts all three strings mirrored to the debug TTY
and reconstructs the complete report. It remains backward-compatible with
two-page PX5 captures.

The third page is intentionally a microscope rather than a duplicate. It
stores raw SPU DMA readback words for one-block and four-block BCR shapes plus
Stop/DMA-read mode poll counts and forced-stable comparison hashes, repeated
GPUSTAT reads after IRQ and DMA-direction writes, isolated Timer 2
mode/counter/I_STAT snapshots, raw SPU voice-register masks, consecutive OTC
CHCR reads, an exact NCLIP scene-A settle sweep from 47 through 64 NOPs, and an
immediate-versus-settled OP comparison. This extra data reveals corruption and
state-transition shapes that a checksum or one-shot pass/fail result cannot.

The timing minimum is normally the least-interrupted measurement; the min/max
gap records IRQ or hardware jitter instead of hiding it. BIOS revisions can
legitimately program different bus values, while the full GTE observations can
distinguish a true latency window from magnitude-dependent partial accumulation.

The exact instruction blocks use `.set noreorder` and literal repetitions, so
the workload does not depend on LLVM loop generation. Timer reset, workload,
and timer read are emitted in one non-inlined assembly block, with inputs live
before the reset. Harmless marker instructions outside the measured interval
let the final PS-X machine code be audited byte-for-byte. Five measurements are
kept per record; no average is used because an interrupt-inflated average is a
poor estimate of instruction cost.

The four short-cache records complement the 4 KiB aggregate. Their targets
are 16-byte aligned and enter at linked word offsets 0, 1, and 2, while the
timing wrappers occupy different direct-map indices. Comparing `42`–`44`
reveals entry-position/refill-shape cost; comparing `42` with `45` isolates a
cold refill from the same call/return path when warm. The final-EXE audit
checks these layouts rather than trusting source alignment alone.

The GPU DMA records send only GP0 NOP commands, so they do not alter VRAM or
the photographed capture. Records `68`–`6A` deliberately hold the 256-word
payload constant while changing BCR shape. That separates actual bus/FIFO
cost from completion models based only on block count; record `6B` also
exposes linked-list header and node-transition overhead.

The line records start Timer 2 immediately before the first GP0 packet and
stop only after GPUSTAT command-ready returns. CPU write stalls and the final
GPU drain are therefore both included. Short/long pairs separate command
setup from per-pixel cost; monochrome/Gouraud pairs expose interpolation cost.
They draw into off-screen VRAM and do not cover the photographed capture.

The final two timing records use single uncached-RAM reads as a refresh
detector. Interrupts are disabled during each scan. Timer 0 timestamps only
the contended reads, avoiding a counter read on every iteration that would
itself disturb the cadence. `70` reports the interval between refresh slots;
`71` reports the largest extra wait above the uncontended read floor. These
two records occupy the previously unused cells on timing page 15.

PX6 includes the observed values from conformance cases 116–137 in fixed order,
preserving the exact partial or stale values needed to infer silicon latency.

## SCPH-9902 calibration (PX6 `B2761BE1`)

The final PAL hardware capture established these constraints:

- NCLIP's scene-A MAC0 stayed at `0x00000874` for every read gap from 47
  through 64 NOPs. Other predecessor sequences produced `0x00002764`,
  `0xFFFFB964`, and `0x00007674` for the same scene. This is internal
  state/history-dependent accumulation, not a fixed command-result latency.
- OP produced MAC1/MAC2/MAC3 = `-768`, `1536`, `0` when issued immediately
  after its CTC2/MTC2 seed, and `-768`, `1536`, `-768` after 64 NOPs. The
  arithmetic is correct; the discrepancy belongs to input/control-write
  commitment.
- GP1 IRQ acknowledgement and DMA-direction changes become visible in
  GPUSTAT one read after the write.
- Timer reached-target/reached-wrap bits survive a mode write and clear on a
  mode-register read. Both Timer 2 interrupt probes raised I_STAT bit 6.
- SPUCNT's low-six-bit SPUSTAT mirror took 24-27 status polls to settle.
  SPUSTAT DMA-request bits did not assert before the DMA channel was armed, so
  they must not be used as a pre-start readiness condition. The captured SPU
  readback words are therefore diagnostic only, not RAM-content calibration.

These are behavioral constraints, not permission to reproduce them with
read-triggered special cases. GPU, GTE, and SPU timing should be scheduled in
bus/SPU/GTE time so unrelated instruction sequences observe the same effects.

## Reading the payload off a console

There are two independent readout paths carrying the *same* bytes.

**QR.** The proven path. Scan each page, keep the `PX8/<page>/<chunk>/C:<crc>`
text. Self-validating and visible, but paged and manual. A conformance capture
is one page; a characterisation capture is six. The page header carries the
total, so there is no fixed count to remember.

**Audio link.** The disc streams the whole 2,637-byte payload out of the SPU as
binary FSK and loops it in hardware, forever, with no CPU involvement. Point a
capture card at the console, record, and decode:

```sh
python3 tools/hwtest-audio-decode.py capture.wav --emit-pages pages.txt
python3 tools/hwtest-report.py pages.txt
```

One repetition takes about 13.6 seconds, so any recording longer than that
contains a complete copy, and a repetition spoiled by a glitch costs the next
11.6 seconds rather than another burn. The decoder re-emits the payload in the
QR wire format on purpose, so both paths feed the identical report pipeline and
cannot drift apart.

Four tone rates are available, cycled with SQUARE on the capture page. They all
replay the SAME uploaded stream at a lower SPU pitch, which stretches each block
over proportionally more output samples: a slower mode lowers both tones and the
baud rate together and multiplies energy per bit while costing no extra SPU RAM,
which matters because the fast stream already fills most of it. The decoder
sweeps all four and detects which was used, so a fallback needs no flag. A
calibration section of each pure tone precedes the data, so a failed decode can
be diagnosed offline instead of by burning again.

Modulation is FSK because it is amplitude-independent: capture chains apply AGC
and arbitrary volume, which would destroy on/off keying but cannot change which
tone is present. Each bit is exactly one ADPCM block, 28 samples at 44.1 kHz,
and the two tones (1575 Hz and 3150 Hz) fit a whole number of cycles into that
block so blocks concatenate without a phase discontinuity. Both land on exact
DFT bins of a 28-sample window, making a bit decision a two-bin comparison with
no filter design.

The emulator path is verified end to end by `make hwtest-audio`, which records
the SPU output, decodes it, and parses the result. The recovered bytes are
byte-identical to the QR payload, at both the fast rate and a slower fallback
rate.

`make hwtest-audio-chain` goes further and degrades that recording the way a
real capture chain does, requiring the decoder to still recover the identical
payload. All twelve cases pass: resampling to 48/32/96 kHz, a 20x gain range,
hard clipping, DC offset, band-limiting, 25% noise, and a stacked worst case.

**Recordings are resampled to 44.1 kHz before decoding, and this is not
optional.** The link's bit clock IS the console's 44.1 kHz sample rate, so at
48 kHz a bit spans 30.48 samples and the tones no longer land on exact DFT
bins. A 48 kHz recording fails completely without that step, and 48 kHz is what
OBS records by default. That proves the encoding and framing; it does
not prove analog robustness through a real capture chain, which only a console
recording can establish.

## Headless validation

None of these need pad input, a GUI, or QR scanning: the tier-1 battery runs at
boot and mirrors every page to the TTY.

```sh
make hwtest-capture   # build guest + run headless -> build/hwtest-capture.log
make hwtest-diff      # audit the linked EXE, then diff the capture vs baseline
make hwtest-audio     # record SPU output, decode it, parse the recovered payload
make hwtest-audio-chain  # decode again through simulated capture-card damage
make hwtest-baseline  # deliberately re-pin the baseline (review the diff first)
make hwtest-capture-full  # FULL characterisation capture (timing, memctl, precision)
make hwtest-diff-full     # ...diffed against px8-emulator-full-v<version>.txt
make hwtest-baseline-full # ...and re-pinned
make hwtest-capture-perf  # PERF A/B run: the sweep, then the register A/B group
make hwtest-diff-perf     # ...gated on the warm records
make hwtest-probe-capture ROW=<n>  # one TARGETED PROBES row, for before/after diffs
make hwtest-silicon SILICON=<payload.txt>   # compare against a console capture
```

`hwtest-capture` side-loads the EXE but mounts the CUE with `--disc`. The CD
battery needs a disc in the drive; against a driveless EXE every CD command
burns its full poll budget timing out, which alone exhausts the instruction cap
before the capture encodes. Booting the CUE directly instead produces no guest
TTY at all.

`hwtest-diff` is the routine gate. Its baseline is a conformance capture, so it
covers the 200 case verdicts and the expected/observed values of the failing
ones, and nothing else: since PX8 made the other blocks optional it has not
seen a timing minimum or a precision value. `hwtest-diff-full` covers those,
against a FULL baseline. Both the guest EXE and the headless capture are
byte-reproducible, so a difference is a real behaviour change rather than
toolchain noise; but see "Timing records move when the guest binary changes"
before reading a timing drift as a regression.

Two baselines are pinned, and they answer different questions:

| File | What it pins | Fails when |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/hardware-refs/px8-emulator-v*.txt` | conformance verdicts and failing values | emulator behaviour moves |
| `docs/hardware-refs/px8-emulator-full-v*.txt` | every captured value | emulator behaviour moves, or guest code shifts alignment |
| `docs/hardware-refs/hwtest-machine-code-*.txt` | the instructions between each probe's markers in the linked EXE | a measured block changes shape |

The second matters because a timing record only means what this document
claims if the instructions inside its measured window are still the ones the
source asked for. `tools/verify-hwtest-machine-code.py` extracts each span
from the linked EXE and digests it. Markers are `ori $zero, $zero, imm` words
(start `0x34000000 | id << 1`, end `start | 1`), which write no register and
which no compiler emits, so the verifier discovers probes by scanning the
image rather than the source: a macro-generated probe or one in another module
is audited like any other. Rows are keyed by probe id and named in the
baseline. A probe that appears, vanishes, reuses an id or loses its end marker
fails the gate. Until v1.20 the markers were `sll`-to-zero words that LLVM
also emits; eight were shared between probes and the six GTE command probes
were never audited at all. The re-keyed v1.20 baseline pins the same word
counts and digests for the original 19 probes, which is the evidence that the
marker change left every measured window untouched.

**The emulator baseline is not hardware truth.** It detects our own drift. The
comparison that matters is `hwtest-silicon` against a real console capture,
and no such payload is currently checked in: the SCPH-9902 capture described
below survives only as the prose in this file. Commit the raw payload text of
the next console run.

The headless run reported `126 pass, 21 fail, 26 info` when the conformance
section had 173 cases (it is `143 pass, 1 fail, 56 info` of 200 at v1.21). The guest's expected values were recalibrated against
SCPH-9902 across several commits (`Match SCPH-9902 hardware fidelity
checkpoint`, `Calibrate final PAL hardware fidelity probes`, `Calibrate OTC and
SPU behavior from SCPH-9902`) while the emulator's GTE was not changed, so
these 21 failures are measured emulator-vs-silicon gaps rather than a
regression.

They cluster almost entirely in GTE NCLIP state-dependent accumulation. Across
the whole big-value settle sweep the emulator returns `0x00000874` where the
console returned `0x00002764`, and the magnitude and controlled-scene variants
diverge similarly. Closing that gap is the highest-value GTE fidelity work
this disc currently points at.

Because expectations are compiled into the guest, revising one costs a rebuild
and a reburn, and old captures cannot be re-judged when understanding
improves. That is the argument for moving judgment host-side and letting the
disc report raw values only.

Completed pages are also mirrored verbatim to the debug TTY with the prefix
`hardware-tests: px6 `. This lets the headless release gate feed the exact same
payload to `hwtest-report.py` without host-side image recognition.

`mkisopsx` currently warns that it does not supply a licensed PS1 system area.
Use the same real-console burn/boot method that worked for the previous test
disc; the generated CUE/BIN pair itself is the artifact validated here.
