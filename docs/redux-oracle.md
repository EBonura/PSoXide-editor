# PCSX-Redux oracle

PSoXide does not include PCSX-Redux source or binaries. The oracle
harness in `emu/crates/parity-oracle` launches an external patched
Redux build and talks to `lua/oracle.lua` over stdin/stdout.

The current expected Redux line is:

- repo: `https://github.com/EBonura/pcsx-redux.git`
- branch: `psoxide-bindings`
- known local commit: `23cdc6ab` (`Expose audio drain hooks for PSoXide oracle`)

Set the binary explicitly when possible:

```bash
export PSOXIDE_REDUX_BIN=/home/user/Desktop/repos/pcsx-redux/pcsx-redux
export PSOXIDE_BIOS=/absolute/path/to/SCPH1001.BIN
```

If `PSOXIDE_REDUX_BIN` is not set, `OracleConfig` tries the local
`/home/user/Desktop/repos/pcsx-redux` fallback paths.

## Required bindings

`oracle.lua` requires a Redux build that exposes these Lua surfaces:

- stepping and execution: `PCSX.stepIn()`, `PCSX.runExecute()`,
  `PCSX.setQuietPauseResume()`
- memory/register access: `PCSX.getMemPtr()`, `PCSX.getRomPtr()`,
  `PCSX.getScratchPtr()`, `PCSX.getRegisters()`, `PCSX.getCPUCycles()`,
  `PCSX.invalidateCache()`
- display/audio capture: `PCSX.GPU.takeScreenShot()`,
  `PCSX.drainAudioFrames()`
- controller overrides: `PCSX.SIO0.slots[port].pads[1].setOverride()`
  and `clearOverride()`

Run the quick protocol checks with:

```bash
make oracle-smoke
```

## Side-loaded EXE parity

Side-loaded SDK canaries normally use PSoXide's HLE BIOS path. That is
good for fast local frame probes, but it is not a Redux parity setup:
Redux runs the real BIOS ROM, and PSoXide's HLE dispatcher deliberately
does not match the real BIOS instruction stream.

The Redux side-load oracle uses this contract instead:

1. Start both emulators from reset with the same BIOS.
2. Run the real BIOS warmup on both sides. The default is
   `DISC_FAST_BOOT_WARMUP_STEPS` (`10_000_000` steps).
3. Copy the same PSX-EXE payload into RAM.
4. Clear the EXE BSS range.
5. Seed PC, GP, and SP/FP from the EXE header.
6. Invalidate Redux's instruction cache.
7. Acknowledge any already-latched VBlank IRQ, advance both emulators
   to future VBlank checkpoints, and compare visible display hashes.

Run the side-load parity probe with:

```bash
make oracle-side-load
```

By default it uses `build/examples/mipsel-sony-psx/release/hello-tri.exe`.
Override inputs with:

```bash
export PSOXIDE_ORACLE_EXE=/absolute/path/to/example.exe
export PSOXIDE_ORACLE_EXE_WARMUP=10000000
export PSOXIDE_ORACLE_EXE_MAX_STEPS_PER_FRAME=2000000
export PSOXIDE_ORACLE_EXE_FRAMES=3
export PSOXIDE_ORACLE_EXE_SETTLE_STEPS=0
```

The default side-load target checks three VBlank checkpoints, enough to
prove the `hello-tri` double-buffer display-start sequence
`Y=0 -> Y=240 -> Y=0` against Redux. Raise
`PSOXIDE_ORACLE_EXE_FRAMES` while investigating deeper frame drift; any
mismatch fails the test and prints both hashes.
`PSOXIDE_ORACLE_EXE_SETTLE_STEPS` is normally `0`; set it only when
probing whether a mismatch is
edge-sampling phase or actual display/GPU state.

The SDK `vsync()` helper polls Timer 1 with HBlank clock source. For
Redux parity, PSoXide intentionally mirrors Redux's counter model:
Timer 1's VBlank sync/reset mode bits do not reset the counter at the
VBlank IRQ edge. Side-loaded double-buffer samples depend on this phase.

## Managing Redux changes

Keep Redux changes in the Redux fork/branch. Keep PSoXide changes in
this repo. Do not vendor a Redux binary into PSoXide.

When a new oracle feature needs a Redux C++ Lua binding:

1. Commit the binding in `EBonura/pcsx-redux:psoxide-bindings`.
2. Rebuild Redux.
3. Update this document's known commit.
4. Update `oracle.lua`'s required-binding header.
5. Add or update a PSoXide smoke test that fails clearly when the
   binding is missing.

The PSoXide commit should document the Redux commit it expects. The
operator chooses that build through `PSOXIDE_REDUX_BIN`.
