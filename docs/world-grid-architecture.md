The world grid has four layers. Keeping them separate is the main guardrail
that lets the editor stay pleasant while the PS1 runtime stays small.

## Layers

```text
Editor authoring model
  psxed-project::WorldGrid
  serde, Vec, ResourceId, mutable node payloads, origin offset

Cooked host manifest
  psxed-project::CookedWorldGrid
  validated dimensions, resolved material slots, stripped empty sectors

Cooked binary asset
  .psxw
  AssetHeader + WorldHeader + SectorRecord[] + WallRecord[]

Runtime engine model
  psx_engine::RuntimeRoom<'a>            (PSX-resident wrapper over psx_asset::World)
    .render() -> RoomRender<'a, '_>      (renderer-only API surface)
    .collision() -> RoomCollision<'a, '_> (collision-only API surface)

  psx_engine::GridRoom<'a>               (authoring / test helper, NOT PSX-resident)
```

The engine must not depend on editor nodes, RON, paths, or resource names. The
editor must not be forced to store borrowed runtime slices. The cooker is the
contract boundary.

`GridRoom` / `GridWorld` (the older "engine model" type) are now flagged
**authoring / test helpers** in their doc comments. New runtime systems --
collision, rendering, AI floor sampling -- should grow on top of `RuntimeRoom`,
which holds zero owned state and decodes sectors / walls by value on demand.

## Authoring vs Runtime

The editor's job is to make geometry pleasant to author. Authoring needs a
mutable, type-rich model (`Vec<Wall>`, optional materials, scene-level node
hierarchy, …). The runtime's job is to draw + simulate that geometry on a
33 MHz CPU with 2 MB of RAM. Runtime needs the inverse: zero-copy, byte-table
addressing, no allocator, and a record layout that the GTE / GP0 can fan out
without per-vertex chasing.

Two concrete consequences:

* **No `Vec`, no `String`, no `HashMap` reachable from `RuntimeRoom`**. The
  type is `Copy`. Adding any owned field would break the
  `_assert_copy::<RuntimeRoom>` const-assertion in `psx-engine::world`.

* **Authoring model is allowed to be wider than the runtime model.** The
  cooker is where authoring richness collapses into the runtime's compact
  shape. If the editor lets you assign a material that doesn't exist, that's
  caught at cook time, not at parse time.

## Render vs Collision Split

Same room data, two consumers, two read paths:

* `RoomRender` -- heights and splits for vertex emission, materials for tpage /
  CLUT lookup, world-level lighting state.
* `RoomCollision` -- heights and splits for floor / ceiling sampling, walkable /
  solid bits for stop-or-pass decisions, plus authored vertical floor links for
  runtime room traversal.

Materials are render-only. Walkable / solid bits are collision-only. The two
views are zero-cost `Copy` newtypes over `RuntimeRoom`; they exist to enforce
discipline at the API level (a draw pass cannot accidentally branch on
walkability; a collision query cannot reach a tpage word).

The cooker today writes one record per sector / wall, with both render and
collision concerns interleaved. When the compact byte format lands, those two
concerns split into separate tables -- the cooker pipeline is already organized
by render-emit / collision-emit phases so that future split is a small change.

## adaptive parallels

Bonnie-32's room model deliberately echoes the original adaptive runtime,
because the constraints are similar: 1 MB working set, sector-based level
geometry, integer math throughout. Two lessons we keep:

* **Sectors are a strong addressing mode**, not just a layout convenience. Once
  you commit to "1024 world units per sector, world-grid coords are sector
  coords times sector size," collision lookup becomes `O(1)` and floor / wall
  data becomes table-indexed instead of pointer-chased. Keep the world coords
  → sector coords division single-instruction; resist temptation to break the
  grid.

* **Heights stay room-local once compact format lands.** Today v1 ships
  absolute `i32` heights; the future compact format (see
  `docs/world-format-roadmap.md`) follows TR's `i16`-room-relative trick so a
  level can address ±32 KU vertically with 2 bytes per height set. The
  editor's `editor_preview::VIEW_ANCHOR` already does the same on the
  authoring side, keeping vertex data within i16 range from the camera target.

Two lessons we deliberately ignore for now:

* **Room/floor links are collision traversal, not render portals.** Imported TR
  `room_above` / `room_below` sector links are preserved in the editor model,
  resolved to runtime room indices during playtest cooking, and copied into the
  compact collision sector payload. The runtime uses them to switch the current
  room when the player crosses a floor/ceiling boundary; render visibility still
  follows authored portal rectangles.

* **No `tr_face4` / `tr_face3` lists** today. TR's render path iterates an
  explicit face list per room because sector geometry alone doesn't capture
  decoration (statues, columns, water surface). PSoXide currently emits all
  faces from sector data; once decorative geometry lands, a face table is the
  obvious shape -- but the `RuntimeRoom` API will absorb it as
  `RoomRender::faces()` rather than another concern on `SectorRender`.

* **No item / entity table inside `.psxw`**. TR mixes statics into the room
  blob; we keep entities in scene nodes outside the cooked world. Cleaner
  authoring, slightly more bookkeeping at level-load.

The full TR-to-PSoXide name mapping (per future-format records) lives in
`docs/world-format-roadmap.md`.

The editor/runtime coordinate conversion is documented separately in
[`docs/editor-runtime-coordinates.md`](editor-runtime-coordinates.md). In
short: the editor preview treats North as `+Z`, while the runtime `.psxw`
format treats North as `-Z`; `psxed_project::world_cook` is the single
boundary that flips directions, corners, and split ids.

## Contract

- Sector size is 1024 engine units. Non-1024 authored grids are rejected until
  the runtime supports per-room sector sizes.
- Horizontal face corners are stored as `[NW, NE, SE, SW]`.
- Vertical wall corners are stored as
  `[bottom-left, bottom-right, top-right, top-left]`.
- Sector storage is flat `[x * depth + z]`.
- Empty authored sectors are stripped to `None` in the cooked manifest.
- Floors and ceilings use `walkable` for collision policy.
- Walls use `solid` for collision policy.
- Every rendered floor, ceiling, and wall must resolve to a material slot.
- Editor `ResourceId` material references are mapped to runtime `u16` slots in
  first-use order while scanning sectors.
- Split and direction numeric ids live in `psxed-format::world`; the final
  `.psxw` writer uses those ids.
- **Diagonal walls (`NorthWestSouthEast` / `NorthEastSouthWest`) are rejected
  at cook time**. The data model has the slots so authoring + serialization
  works, but render / pick / collision aren't consistent for diagonals yet.
- **Wall ownership rule**: the physical wall between `(x, z)` and `(x+1, z)`
  is `East(x, z)` *and* `West(x+1, z)`. The editor's PaintWall stamps one
  side; if both opposing sides are authored, the cooker rejects the duplicate
  physical wall so render and collision never double-count the same face. Same
  for North / South.

## Room Budget

Authoring is bounded by the runtime's tolerance:

| Cap                | Value     |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| `MAX_ROOM_WIDTH`   | 32 sectors|
| `MAX_ROOM_DEPTH`   | 32 sectors|
| `MAX_WALL_STACK`   | 4 walls per edge |
| `MAX_ROOM_TRIANGLES` | 2048    |
| `MAX_ROOM_BYTES`   | 64 KiB    |

`WorldGrid::budget()` rolls up populated cells, faces, walls, triangles, plus
exact active `.psxw` wire size and a future-compact-format size estimate (see
the roadmap). The editor inspector shows the rollup and tints any over-cap
metric red. Cooker enforces the same caps so what the editor warns about also
fails at cook time.

## Binary Shape

`.psxw` starts with the standard `AssetHeader` using magic `PSXW`. The v2
payload is:

```text
WorldHeader        (20 B)
SectorRecord[]     (60 B each, width * depth records)
WallRecord[]       (32 B each, wall_count records)
```

Heights are `[i32; 4]` per face. UVs are four packed PS1 `[u, v]` byte pairs
per face. Materials resolve via an external bank slot. No sector logic. No
portals.

A future compact format is sketched in `docs/world-format-roadmap.md`; it is
**not** in `psxed-format` as Rust types. The format crate carries only the
active wire records.

## i16 Vertex Safety

`SECTOR_SIZE * MAX_ROOM_WIDTH = 32 * 1024 = 32 768` -- that's the i16 cliff.
A 32×32 room sits exactly on it; bigger rooms silently truncate.

Editor preview: vertices are emitted relative to a per-frame `VIEW_ANCHOR`
(the camera target). The GTE translation absorbs the offset via `cam_local`.
Debug builds assert the relative coord fits i16; release saturates loudly via
the same clamp. With sector_size 1024 this gives ±32 sectors of headroom from
the camera target -- comfortably the editor cap.

Runtime: same trick, room-local i16 heights, room origin added during vertex
emission. Keeps i16 vertex space valid for any room up to the budget cap.
