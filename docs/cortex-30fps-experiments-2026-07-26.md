# cortex_v1 / cortex_v3 30 FPS experiment ledger

Target: both projects sustain one visual frame per two NTSC VBlanks on original
PlayStation hardware, without changing authored geometry, visibility, draw
distance, textures, lighting, fog, subdivision topology, or packet ordering.

Only full poll-bound tape results with guest-frame-aligned visual hashes may
advance the baseline. Diagnostic builds are never used for absolute performance
claims.

Gameplay begins at the first visual frame with both an active room chunk and a
considered room surface. `period <=2vb` groups every 60 Hz update since the
previous visual with the current render and compares their CPU work to
1,128,960 cycles. It excludes the `present` VBlank-edge wait.

| Project | Effective FPS | Visuals / gameplay ticks | Render mean | Render p95 | Render max | Periods <=2 VBlanks | Surfaces / visual | Primitives / visual |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| cortex_v1 | 25.54 | 725 / 1,703 | 764,652 | 1,092,343 | 1,252,038 | 69.8% | 39.8 | 294.6 |

## Accepted measurement infrastructure

### M0: deterministic two-tick visual gate

`lockstep-visuals` caps catch-up at the configured two-tick visual interval.
The guest therefore renders the same simulation states even when two builds
take different wall-clock time. This mode is for visual equivalence only;
ordinary uncapped builds remain the performance truth.

Two independent full runs of each lockstep binary produced:

| Project | Scheduled gameplay cadence | Visual hashes | Final display | Final VRAM |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| cortex_v1 | 29.98 FPS (851 / 1,703) | 1,047 / 1,047 exact | exact | exact |
| cortex_v3 | 30.00 FPS (821 / 1,642) | 927 / 927 exact | exact | exact |

The ordinary cortex_v3 disc rebuilt after adding the feature-gated
instrumentation is byte-identical to the frozen baseline
(`7ac60512...259b4`), proving zero performance-build code drift.

### M1: direct TR-subdivision entry counters

The previous CSV counted authored whole quads, not surfaces entering TR
subdivision. New diagnostic-only counters measure the exact predicate and
successful submission.

| Project | Considered surfaces / visual | TR candidates / visual | TR submitted / visual | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| cortex_v1 | 39.0 | 14.4 | 6.8 | many candidates demote/fall back |
| cortex_v3 | 88.3 | 18.0 | 18.0 | only 20% of considered surfaces enter TR |

This rejects the review estimate that roughly 80 of 88.6 cortex_v3 surfaces
subdivide. The ~413 room primitives per visual are mainly amplified elsewhere,
so precomputed TR lattice attributes remain worth testing but are not the first
architectural lever.

### M2: emulator-owned instruction-cache refill counters

The headless route log now reports refill events, words, and the exact stall
cycles the emulator already charges for cached instruction fetches. The
counters are host-only diagnostic history: they are excluded from save states
and cannot affect guest state or timing.

Full replays of the frozen, unmodified discs reproduced every visual hash and
the final display/VRAM byte-for-byte:

| Project | I-cache stall cycles / visual | Share of mean render | Stall cycles / considered surface |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| cortex_v1 | 176,124 | 23.0% | 4,425 |
| cortex_v3 | 388,056 | 27.6% | 4,365 |

The absolute v3 cost is large enough to justify code-layout experiments, but
the nearly identical per-surface cost argues against a special v3-only cache
pathology. Most of the difference currently tracks v3 doing 2.23x as much
surface work. Candidate R2 must therefore demonstrate a full-replay reduction;
body size or disassembly appearance alone is not evidence.

### M3: room-only packet and command boundaries

Diagnostic builds now count the primitive-arena packets and world commands
emitted strictly inside room-surface draws. Water, props, models, and actors
are outside the boundary. This resolves the ambiguity in the global GPU and
packet-arena counters without changing normal builds.

The cortex_v3 diagnostic replay measured 88.5 whole-quad surface records, 18.0
successful TR subdivisions, 131.9 arena packets, and 169.8 room commands per
visual. The packet arena count is lower because warmed whole quads live in the
persistent prebuilt pool; the command count includes both storage sources.
Thus TR subdivision applies to only 20% of surfaces but still accounts for
about 90 of 170 room commands (four child quads plus one underdraw per
subdivided surface). Template/lattice work remains relevant, but its honest
upper bound is roughly half the room command stream rather than nearly all
surfaces.

### M4: tolerate legacy short initial route rows

The report tool now treats a missing trailing field in the initial route row
as its counter's zero value. Older frozen logs were written before
`port1_polls` was present on that row, and Python's `DictReader` exposes the
missing value as `None`. This is a parser-only compatibility fix; it does not
change any measured row or guest execution.

### M5: exact lockstep scheduling and host-side OT/DMA tracing

The original `lockstep-visuals` implementation only capped the number of
catch-up updates before a visual. A slow and a fast binary could still present
different simulation ticks after accumulated wall-clock backlog, which made a
single transient hash difference look like missing geometry. The diagnostic
mode now waits until exactly one configured visual interval of fixed updates
has completed before rendering. Ordinary builds retain the deadline-driven
scheduler.

The emulator can also record every linked-list GPU DMA node as
`(transfer,address,header)` through `PSOXIDE_DUMP_DMA_LL`. This observes the
actual ordering table without changing guest code generation. Rebuilt
like-for-like cortex_v1 control and candidate discs each emitted 1,047 visual
checkpoints and traversed exactly 2,260,381 DMA nodes.

### M6: shipping-style build without guest telemetry

The benchmark feature set includes `emulator-telemetry`, while the hardware
feature set does not. To test whether stage/counter emission materially
distorted the target, both projects were rebuilt from R10 without that feature
and measured solely through emulator-owned display flips, I-cache counters,
and GPU command logs. Gameplay boundaries were aligned by poll-bound tape
frame, not guest telemetry.

| Project | Instrumented FPS | No-telemetry FPS | I-cache stalls / visual | Final display |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| cortex_v1 | 27.004 | 26.898 | 170,679→167,971 | exact |
| cortex_v3 | 15.713 | 15.713 | 346,461→350,047 | exact |

Removing every guest stage marker and counter did not recover a single
cortex_v3 visual and slightly hurt cortex_v1 through code-layout changes. The
30 FPS gap is therefore real engine work, not profiler overhead. Moving the
counter block behind the GPU kick is demoted: it cannot be a production win
because the entire block is already absent from production builds.

### M7: warmed room-surface micro-profile and workload-density check

The surface micro-profile was replayed first in its original diagnostic form,
which deliberately disables the warmed packet path, then again with that path
temporarily enabled. Both are instrumentation builds and are used only for
proportions. The warmed-path cortex_v3 run measured:

| Counter | Cycles / visual |
|---|---:|
| `room_surface_draw` | 917,896 |
| projection gather/validity | 50,725 |
| screen bounds | 7,874 |
| kind decode | 6,945 |
| material lookup/animation | 30,459 |
| backface | 13,778 |
| lighting | 62,782 |
| instrumented submission leaves | 369,391 |

Kind plus material—the main static interpretation a residency record would
remove—account for only 37,404 cycles in this deliberately slowed build.
Submission is nearly 10x larger, and the unassigned remainder includes
option/risk decisions, TR reprojection, branches, and profiler overhead. This
falsifies the reviews' predicted 200–320k saving from a surface record by
itself. A record may still help a genuinely smaller submit architecture, but
static classification is not the main missing budget.

The ordinary R10 tapes also rule out a portal loop. cortex_v1 and cortex_v3
draw almost the same number of cells (23.7 versus 25.4 per visual), while v3
contains 88.9 considered quads versus 40.1. That is 3.50 surfaces per drawn
cell in v3 versus 1.69 in v1. v3 screen-rejects 20.7 and backface-rejects 6.1
of those quads; the remaining density is authored visible geometry. The same
engine is doing roughly twice the surface work, not revisiting rooms through a
portal cycle.

## Accepted engine changes

### V0: reuse the cell vertical AABB extent

The visible-cell loop previously derived the same `half_y` extent separately
for the frustum and portal-window tests. It now retains the first result and
reuses it when both tests run, while preserving the lazy calculation on paths
that need only one test.

| Project | FPS | Mean render | p95 render | I-cache stalls / visual | `room_cell_select` / visual | Visual proof |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| cortex_v1 | 25.54→25.61 | 764,652→763,256 | 1,092,343→1,086,879 | 176,124→174,895 | 56,349→55,105 | 1,047 / 1,047 exact; display and VRAM exact |
| cortex_v3 | 14.03→14.07 | 1,404,382→1,401,072 | 1,994,267→1,989,066 | 388,056→386,202 | 49,706→48,221 | 927 / 927 exact; display and VRAM exact |

Surface, primitive, and visible-cell counts are unchanged. This is a small
engine-wide win rather than the main answer, but it meets the strict visual
gate on both projects and reduces the targeted cell-selection work.

### V4: exact cylinder-prop UV edge interpolation

Cylinder/card props evaluate authored quad UVs at runtime. Most generated
vertices lie on `u` or `v` edges, where the full four-corner bilinear equation
reduces exactly to a two-corner interpolation. The runtime now takes those
four endpoint paths while retaining the original equation for interior
samples. An exhaustive host test compares all 256 positions on all four edges
across varied corner sets against the original implementation.

| Project | FPS | Mean render | I-cache stalls / visual | Visual proof |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| cortex_v1 | 25.61→25.58 | 763,256→763,475 | 174,895→172,802 | 1,047 / 1,047 exact; identical DMA-node count |
| cortex_v3 | 14.07→14.25 | 1,401,072→1,394,252 | 386,202→374,342 | 925 / 925 exact; display and VRAM exact |

The v1 render delta is within replay noise, while v3 saves 6,820 mean render
cycles and 11,860 I-cache stall cycles per visual. This is retained as an
engine-wide, data-layout-preserving win.

## Rejected engine changes

### R1 retest: zero-weight fog bypass

The earlier zero-fog idea was retested in five shapes against the newer exact
gate. The mathematically safe form only bypassed four fog blends when all four
prepared fog weights were zero; it never changed packet topology, geometry,
ordering, or subdivision. The best inline v3 result was 14.25→14.40 FPS,
mean render 1,394,252→1,374,463 cycles, and I-cache stalls
374,342→367,764 per visual. Its lockstep v3 run matched 925/925 hashes.

That form perturbed one v1 presentation boundary. Moving the test into
`RuntimeRoomLighting`, trying a four-compare test and a single-OR test, and
forcing the fog shader out of line could each make either project's full tape
exact, but never both simultaneously. The out-of-line form that was exact in
v1 saved only 9,949 v3 render cycles and changed 1/925 v3 lockstep hashes; the
compact inline form that was exact in v3 changed 2/1,046 v1 hashes. Final VRAM
and display images were identical in every variant, but the full-route
guest-frame gate intentionally rejects transient differences too. All R1
variants were removed.

### R3a: borrow `WorldSurfaceOptions` in the per-surface loop

Replacing the by-value `WorldSurfaceOptions` argument to
`draw_indexed_cached_room_surface` with a reference was exact across 1,047
cortex_v1 and 926 cortex_v3 lockstep checkpoints. It is nevertheless a severe
cross-project regression:

| Project | FPS | Mean render | I-cache stalls / visual |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| cortex_v1 | 25.58→22.15 | 763,475→877,235 | 172,802→211,058 |
| cortex_v3 | 14.25→14.29 | 1,394,252→1,386,410 | 374,342→372,001 |

The dependent loads/register pressure improve the v3 mix slightly while
expanding v1's hot working set enough to lose 3.43 FPS. The borrow-only change
was removed. A future surface-record experiment must reduce interpretation as
a whole; it cannot assume that replacing a large value argument with a pointer
is cheaper on MIPS-I.

### R3b: residency-cached surface class bits

The prebuilt-quad residency pool was widened by one byte per surface and used
to cache surface kind plus animated/translucent material classification. The
draw path consumed those bits while leaving geometry, material resolution,
subdivision, packet construction, and ordering unchanged.

All 925 comparable cortex_v3 lockstep hashes matched. The normal tape,
however, showed no useful reduction: FPS stayed 14.25, mean render moved
1,394,252→1,395,491 cycles, and I-cache stalls moved
374,342→372,657 per visual. The lockstep render mean moved only
1,451,868→1,451,511 cycles. This prices the cached decisions at noise while
adding 2 KiB to the eight-slot pool, so the change was removed. A complete
`SurfaceDrawRecord` must eliminate substantially more interpretation than
kind and two material predicates to justify its data traffic.

### R3c: six-entry per-cell option table

The exact `(floor|ceiling|wall) × (calm|risky)` option results and prepared
depths were built once per accepted cell, replacing per-surface calls to the
depth/subdivision option constructors. All 36 focused renderer tests passed,
but the larger stack record and indexed loads are substantially worse on
MIPS-I. The cortex_v1 lockstep tape moved from 791,057 to 849,858 mean render
cycles, p95 from 1,124,007 to 1,189,537, and I-cache stalls from 171,364 to
186,976 per visual; one of 1,046 hashes also changed. The table was removed
without spending a cortex_v3 run. Any eventual compiled record must encode
the few decisions compactly in the record itself, not indirect through a
copied `WorldSurfaceOptions` table.

### R10a: defer the forced-split options copy

After R10, the largest named `memcpy` caller was a 68-byte
`WorldSurfaceOptions` clone before projected-quad hardware-extent checks. A
lazy form evaluated the identical safety predicate from the scalar edge
threshold and constructed the forced-split options only on the fallback.
Disassembly confirmed that the copy moved off the common accepted-quad path.

It helped cortex_v3 lockstep by 6,610 render cycles but hurt cortex_v1 by
856 cycles, increased its I-cache stalls by 1,002, and changed one of 1,044
common visual checkpoints (with two cadence-set replacements). Its ordinary
cortex_v1 run also fell 26.99→26.78 FPS. The change was removed; this is
another measured instance where adding a branch/code-layout change around a
large by-value options object is not an engine-wide win on the 4 KiB
direct-mapped instruction cache.

### R11/R11b: avoid the full portal-result reset

The second-largest named post-R10 `memcpy` caller was
`PortalVisibilityResult::clear`: every camera refresh copied the complete
fixed-capacity `EMPTY` result, including 64 frustum and 32 frontier slots.
R11 reset only counts and statistics, relying on every declared reader being
count-bounded. It changed two cortex_v1 lockstep images, proving that this
logical contract is not strong enough for an exact engine change.

R11b restored every previously exposed prefix slot to its exact sentinel
before zeroing the counts, preserving the original full-pool invariant because
all never-used tails begin empty. It saved 2,072 mean render cycles and 2,651
I-cache stall cycles in cortex_v1 lockstep, but still changed one of 1,046
common images. Both forms were removed. The portal result keeps its full reset
until the implicit state/layout sensitivity is isolated separately.

### R12/R12b: leave camera duplicate-set overflow storage uninitialized

Four adjacent `memcpy` callsites in the camera solve were the construction of
four 356-byte `CheckedCameraCells` values. Each copied a 72-entry
`u32::MAX` fallback array even though its `len` began at zero. R12 changed the
entries to `MaybeUninit`; LLVM replaced the four reads/copies with one
1,424-byte zero fill. R12b separated that logically uninitialized overflow
storage from the initialized bitset/count, reducing the generated
initialization to a single 272-byte zero fill and shrinking
`update_vblanks_with_collision_rooms` by 228 bytes.

The optimized form preserves duplicate detection for every key and passed all
25 focused camera tests. It saved 2,739 camera cycles per gameplay tick in
cortex_v1 lockstep and 2,520 in the ordinary tape. However, the new layout
added 1,797 I-cache stall cycles per visual in lockstep and 1,976 in the
ordinary run. Effective FPS remained 26.99, two-vblank periods slipped
79.2%→79.0%, and one presentation checkpoint moved (all 1,045 common images
were exact). With no net engine gain, both forms were removed before spending
a cortex_v3 run.

### R13: const-specialize cached-room depth/subdivision policies

The cached-room entry points were temporarily made const-generic over the
generated depth and subdivision modes. This forced a project-specific MIPS
monomorph and should have removed every policy branch if the existing enum
arguments were blocking constant propagation.

The cortex_v3 lockstep replay was identical to R10 in every reported
performance metric: mean render 1,416,120, p95 2,002,178, max 2,259,241, and
321,902 I-cache stall cycles per visual. All 925 display hashes matched. LLVM
was already propagating these constants through the shared engine; the API
change generated the same machine behaviour and was removed.

### R14/R14b: accelerate TR root world-to-view transforms

R14 moved the three/four root transforms before TR subdivision from the CPU to
the otherwise-idle GTE. It exposed genuine arithmetic headroom: cortex_v3
lockstep mean render fell 40,675 cycles and p95 fell 46,225. It is not
visually valid. The GTE combines yaw and pitch in one matrix operation while
the established path rounds after yaw and again after pitch. That difference
changed 820 of 925 display hashes and reduced the primitive mean from 418.2 to
376.3, so the experiment was immediately removed.

R14b retained the exact CPU arithmetic and batched three/four vertices behind
one shared camera-basis load. All 925 hashes matched and lockstep render saved
599 cycles, but the ordinary v3 replay regressed 3,966 mean render cycles,
p95 regressed 10,225, and two-vblank coverage fell 0.9%→0.5%. LLVM already
hoists enough of the original calls; the explicit batch's layout is worse in
the production path. It too was removed.

### R15: explicitly outline the TR room entry leaves

Both cached-room TR entry functions were marked `#[inline(never)]` to test a
narrower version of the reviews' code-layout proposal without disturbing the
ordinary warm path. The complete cortex_v3 lockstep capture was exactly
identical to R10—every timing percentile and I-cache count, plus all 925
hashes. LLVM already keeps these large generic entries out of the caller, so
the attributes were removed as redundant.

### R6: offline whole-subdivision proof is not currently sound

The proposed `WHOLE` classification requires a conservative minimum
camera-to-surface distance over every legal camera position. The engine's
current content contract does not provide that volume to the cooker: free
orbit and collision-bypassing camera modes exist, and rooms without a complete
camera collision hull are valid. Under the proposal's own fail-open rule,
every surface without such a proof remains `SPLIT`; classifying any of them
`WHOLE` would change the subdivision topology for a legal view.

Consequently the current engine-wide form is a no-op if correct and a visual
regression if made aggressive. It is rejected until projects can opt into a
cooked, enforced camera-volume contract. The existing runtime projected-edge
test remains authoritative.

### T1a: defer fallback material-array clear

`apply_current_active_room_fields` previously cleared the full current-room
material array before scanning the active window and copying the resident
room's real materials over it. Moving that clear to the actual missing-room
case preserves state, but this call is not frequent enough on the measured
steady-state path: cortex_v1 update mean improved only about 105 cycles.
Meanwhile code-layout/I-cache effects raised render mean 791,057→794,762,
raised I-cache stalls 171,364→174,890, and shifted one lockstep presentation
boundary. The reorder was removed. T1 must instead eliminate repeated
residency/material copies at their callers, guarded by explicit dirty state.

### T1b: skip settled residency reconciliation

The residency owner retained the ordered desired set plus its visible/pinned
prefix and skipped scheduler reconciliation only when both were unchanged and
every requested room was resident or already loading. The CD pump, VRAM
eviction pass, and persistent-asset requests remained active, so no streaming
progress was delayed. This saved 2,397 update cycles/tick and 2,342
`sim_residency` cycles/tick on cortex_v1, but render mean rose 5,714 cycles,
I-cache stalls rose 5,116 per visual, and 1/1,046 lockstep hashes changed.
The dirty state and fast path were removed. This proves repeated scheduler
planning is real but too small to justify more hot-code footprint in this
layout.

### T1c: decode only the selected collision floor triangle

Out-of-band return-address sampling resolved the previously opaque
compiler-builtins `memcpy` cost. Two copies inside
`RoomCollision::sector` accounted for 37.8% of all sampled `memcpy`
instructions: collision was decoding and returning a 152-byte render-rich
`WorldSector`, including materials, UVs, ceiling data, and both split
triangles, even when the character or camera needed one floor triangle.

The accepted path decodes only the selected floor triangle's flags and
heights. It applies the same horizontal override records and interpolation
inputs as the full decoder. Renderer data, portal state, draw order, and
packet emission are untouched.

| Project | FPS | Update mean | Camera mean | Render p95 | I-cache / visual |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| cortex_v1 | 25.58→25.97 | 143,171→127,681 | 37,433→35,481 | 1,098,246→1,096,729 | 172,802→174,334 |
| cortex_v3 | 14.25→15.09 | 159,415→137,814 | 42,157→40,851 | 1,996,668→1,977,978 | 374,342→357,343 |

All 925 cortex_v3 lockstep hashes matched. In cortex_v1, all 1,045 common
checkpoints matched; one old checkpoint was replaced by one newly rendered
checkpoint when the faster update crossed a presentation deadline. There
were no mismatching images. The normal tapes rendered 11 additional v1
frames and 23 additional v3 frames. Focused character, camera, and asset
tests also pass.

### T1d: use the header-only sector probe for character walls

Character cylinder wall checks decoded the full sector solely to read its wall
range. The camera path already had a collision-only probe containing exactly
`has_floor`, `first_wall`, and `wall_count`; the character path now uses the
same probe and probe-wall accessor.

All 925 cortex_v3 common lockstep hashes and all 1,045 cortex_v1 common
lockstep hashes match. As with T1c, cortex_v1 replaced one presentation
checkpoint after crossing a deadline, with no mismatching common image.

| Project | FPS | Update mean | Two-vblank periods | I-cache / visual |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| cortex_v1 | 25.97→26.28 | 128,321→118,072 (lockstep) | 71.4%→73.9% | 174,334→171,976 |
| cortex_v3 | 15.09→15.38 | 138,437→125,478 (lockstep) | 0.2%→0.5% | 357,343→348,665 |

### R10: borrow the world pass at flush

Return-address profiling resolved the largest remaining `memcpy` caller to
`Playtest::render`: consuming `WorldRenderPass<2048>` by value at
`flush(self)` made LLVM copy the entire 8,212-byte pass into a second stack
slot. The payload was almost entirely its two 2,048-entry ordering arrays.
`flush(&mut self)` removes that copy without changing the pass, command,
packet, or ordering-table representation. MIPS disassembly confirms the
8,212-byte `memcpy` is gone and the renderer body shrank by 12 bytes.

| Project | FPS | Mean render | p95 render | Render periods <=2 VBlanks | Visual proof |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| cortex_v1 | 26.28→26.99 | 770,832→742,800 | 1,100,178→1,069,593 | 73.9%→79.2% | 1,046 / 1,046 exact |
| cortex_v3 | 15.38→15.71 | 1,394,974→1,364,086 | 1,979,163→1,953,348 | 0.5%→0.7% | 925 / 925 exact |

The controlled lockstep deltas are nearly project-independent:
29,735 cycles per visual in cortex_v1 and 29,725 in cortex_v3. This is an
engine-wide structural win rather than a workload-specific shortcut.

### V1: carry portal window and far plane into the all-cells fallback

The no-PVS/all-cells path was given the same conservative portal-window AABB
test and far plane as the PVS path, while root/overlap rooms without an
incoming aperture retained the existing fail-open no-far behaviour. All 926
cortex_v3 lockstep hashes matched, but the tape exposed no usable window in
the fallback rooms: considered surfaces were unchanged (88.6→88.7), mean
render moved only 55 cycles, and FPS remained 14.25. The extra runtime branch
was removed. A useful portal refinement must preserve each admitting wedge
rather than relying on information absent from the fallback.

### V2: reject cells outside every individual portal wedge

The visible-cell path kept its component-wise portal-window union as a broad
test, then required a surviving cell to intersect at least one individual
admitting portal wedge. Scratch capacity matched the 64-frustum visibility
result and overflow was explicitly fail-open. A focused host test confirmed
the intended disjoint-window OR semantics.

The refinement is not conservative with respect to the current room-cell
representation: it changed 61 of 926 cortex_v3 lockstep display hashes,
beginning at guest frame 698, which is direct missing-geometry evidence. It
also made the normal run slower:

| FPS | Mean render | p95 render | I-cache stalls / visual |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 14.25→14.03 | 1,394,252→1,413,654 | 1,996,668→2,017,582 | 374,342→383,976 |

The per-wedge scan was removed. The conservative union remains mandatory
until a cooked cell mask can prove coverage against actual submitted
geometry, not only a cell AABB and one clipped path.

### V5: use the existing coarse-yaw visible-cell cache mode

The default `vis-anchor-pvs-candidates` build caches the cooked PVS candidate
set and performs the conservative camera/portal AABB checks during each draw.
The already-implemented `vis-coarse-yaw` alternative was replayed unchanged to
test whether an apparently unapplied visibility option could cache a tighter,
pre-culled list.

All 925 cortex_v3 lockstep hashes matched, but the actual workload did not
change: 47.3 candidate cells, 26.6 drawn cells, and 93.3 surfaces per visual in
both builds. The ordinary tape regressed mean render by 1,159 cycles and p95 by
3,659 while gaining one cadence-quantized visual. The conservative blocker and
safety rules retain the same cells, so this mode does not solve the density
problem and is not made the default. The finer-yaw form (neither anchor nor
coarse-yaw feature) was also replayed; it produced metrics exactly identical
to R10 and the same 925 hashes.

### G1: GPU timing and texture-window command census

The normal R10 tapes show that the GPU is not the component missing the
two-vblank target. Across gameplay visuals, cortex_v1 averages 621,664 GPU
cycles and peaks at 928,430; cortex_v3 averages 713,238 and peaks at 878,670.
The CPU render stage alone averages 742,800 and 1,364,086 cycles respectively,
and the measured ordering-table wait is negligible. The GPU therefore finishes
inside the CPU critical path even in cortex_v3.

Texture-window commands are highly redundant in stream order, but too small to
matter at this scale:

| Project | Commands | Draws | Texture-window writes | Window changes | Redundant writes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| cortex_v1 | 691.2 | 350.2 | 337.0 | 19.4 | 317.7 |
| cortex_v3 | 1,045.7 | 505.6 | 498.3 | 102.7 | 395.6 |

Each redundant window is one GP0 data word attached to a packet. Even a
zero-cost, final-order-aware suppression mechanism could remove only about 396
words per cortex_v3 visual, while it would complicate the packet header and
ordering-table ownership needed to prevent texture-state leakage. It cannot
recover the roughly 350k CPU cycles still needed for a stable two-vblank
cortex_v3 frame. Texture-window dedup is rejected by this hard upper bound;
future GPU work is gated on contrary real-hardware evidence.

### R4/R4a: precompute lattice attributes or remove leaf copies

Two variants tested the proposed one-level TR lattice data rewrite. A full
residency pool stored the five midpoint UV/RGB attributes per eligible surface,
costing 57,344 bytes at the existing room/surface limits. It preserved output
but increased cortex_v3 mean render work by 14,110 cycles versus the frozen
baseline (17,420 versus V0), with effective FPS unchanged at 14.03. A smaller
variant kept the existing attributes but addressed child leaves by lattice
index instead of copying four compact vertices; it increased mean render work
by 3,903 cycles versus the frozen baseline.

Both variants were removed. On this MIPS target the added helper/argument and
resident-memory traffic costs more than the five midpoint interpolations or
four small leaf copies they replace.

### R5: packet template copy/patch to remove an arena double-write

The proposed double-write does not exist in optimized MIPS code. Disassembly
of `submit_textured_gouraud_quad_leaf_uv_words_prepared_depth` shows the packet
words written directly to the address computed from the primitive arena. Its
72-byte stack frame holds saved registers and scalar spills; no temporary
`QuadTexturedGouraud` is materialized and copied. The 832-byte function has 208
instructions, one call (command insertion), and one direct sequence of packet
stores. Replacing the constructor with explicit reserve-and-patch code would
only restate code LLVM already emits, so R5 is rejected without perturbing the
runtime.

### R8: retain TR identity GTE state across surfaces

Hoisting the identity projection load out of each adaptive subdivision
submission gave cortex_v3 a small local win: 14.07→14.18 FPS, mean render
1,401,072→1,398,923 cycles, and I-cache stalls 386,202→382,926 per visual.
All 927 v3 lockstep hashes matched.

It is not a valid engine-wide change. The fully hoisted form changed one of
1,047 cortex_v1 frames. Restoring the triangle load made every v1 hash exact,
but regressed its normal render mean by 2,302 cycles and I-cache stalls by
2,893 per visual. Two lazy ownership variants changed 37–38 v1 frames, proving
that other surface paths can replace implicit GTE control state between
submissions. The experiment was fully reverted; state loads remain local to
each submission.

### R9: cook every cylinder-prop UV into the surface record

Moving the complete bilinear result into each cooked cylinder surface improved
cortex_v3 more than the edge-only runtime change (mean render work fell by
about 30,000 cycles), but altered the resident record/schema and produced
transient painter-order differences in the first lockstep comparison. The
schema rewrite was removed in favour of V4, which captures a measurable part
of the win without changing data layout or packet identity.
