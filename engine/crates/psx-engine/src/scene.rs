//! Scene trait + per-frame context.
//!
//! A `Scene` is whatever your game wants to run. The engine calls
//! [`Scene::init`] once at boot, then [`Scene::update`] + [`Scene::render`]
//! in a loop, passing a [`Ctx`] that carries the live-per-frame
//! things the scene needs: the current pad state (with edge-detection
//! helpers), the simulation and visual-frame counters, the display cadence,
//! and a [`FrameBuffer`] ready to draw into.
//!
//! The split into `update` + `render` is cosmetic -- both get the
//! same `Ctx`. Keeping them separate reads better and makes it easy
//! to add determinism/replay hooks later (record `Ctx.pad` during
//! update, replay without re-rendering, etc).
