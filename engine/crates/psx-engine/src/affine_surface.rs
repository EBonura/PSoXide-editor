//! Depth-banded affine surface submission for brush worlds.
//!
//! The PS1 GPU interpolates texture coordinates linearly in screen space, so a
//! large polygon close to the camera visibly swims as the view turns. This
//! module splits such polygons in camera space, before projection, so every
//! piece that reaches the GPU spans little enough depth for the affine error
//! to stay small.
//!
//! # How a surface is split
//!
//! A surface is a convex fan of [`AffineVertex`] records in a caller-owned
//! batch. Its vertices are projected once; the fan's triangles are then
//! refined edge by edge. An edge is halved when the mean depth of its two
//! end points, in ordering-table units, is nearer than the profile's band
//! for the current level ([`SurfaceProfile::split_once_below`], then
//! [`SurfaceProfile::split_twice_below`]). The decision depends only on the
//! edge's own end points and level, never on the triangle it belongs to, so
//! two triangles sharing an edge always split it identically and place the
//! same midpoint. The refinement is therefore conforming: no vertex of one
//! piece lies on the open edge of another, which is what lets the GPU
//! rasterise the pieces without pinholes and without any sealing geometry.
//!
//! Depending on which of its three edges split, a triangle becomes two,
//! three or four children (one split edge: a bisection; two: a corner plus a
//! quadrilateral cut on a diagonal; three: three corners and a centre). At
//! most two levels are applied, so one source triangle yields at most twelve
//! GPU packets and needs at most six extra vertices at a time. Neighbouring
//! leaf triangles that form a parallelogram are sent as one GP0 quad, which
//! the GPU rasterises as the triangles (v0, v1, v2) and (v1, v2, v3).
//!
//! Midpoints average position, UV and each colour channel of their end
//! points and are projected through the loaded GTE view like any other
//! vertex, so they land on the true perspective image of the 3D edge.
//!
//! # Packets
//!
//! Every piece is keyed into the ordering table by the GTE's average depth
//! (AVSZ3 or AVSZ4 with the caller's ZSF weights) and dropped when that key
//! is zero or past the table. A piece wholly beyond one screen edge is
//! dropped before it is written. Compact (page-local) surfaces emit a
//! full-window GP0(E2) selector before each GP0(34h/3Ch) textured Gouraud
//! polygon, because other ordering-table packets (character models) can leave
//! a nonzero window active between world polygons; windowed surfaces wrap each
//! polygon in their own GP0(E2) texture-window selector and a full-window
//! reset, and mark the tag with `WINDOWED_POLYGON_TAG`. Tags carry the packet's data-word
//! count in bits 24..31 and its ordering-table slot in bits 0..15, ready for
//! the tagged-stream linker.
