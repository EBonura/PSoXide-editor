//! Deterministic, fixed-capacity combat projectiles.
//!
//! A projectile advances as a swept sphere every simulation tick. The sweep
//! is represented by the same [`WorldCombatCapsule`] primitive as authored
//! melee hitboxes and hurtboxes, so fast bolts cannot tunnel through an actor
//! and the forthcoming unified combat-volume system has one narrow phase.
//! World geometry is supplied through [`ProjectileWorldTracer`]: BSP, grid,
//! and game-specific collision stay outside this policy crate while failures
//! fail closed. Storage is all-zero-valid and heap-free for PS1 BSS use.
