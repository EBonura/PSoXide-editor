//! Souls-like game-entity runtime (phase 3 of
//! docs/game-runtime-plan.md): SoA state over cooked
//! [`LevelGameEntityRecord`]s with per-archetype tick dispatch across
//! the souls state grammar (Idle / Patrol / Aggro / Windup / Attack /
//! Recover / Staggered / Dead), adopted from hl-psx's prop AI shape
//! with two deliberate differences: thinking gates on the
//! portal-expanded ACTIVE ROOM set instead of BSP PVS, and melee
//! windup/commit/punish is the first-class attack grammar.
//!
//! Movement is Character-bound and motor-honest (the phase-3 seam
//! note): speeds come from the cooked record's Character-derived
//! `walk_speed`/`run_speed` (patrol walks, chase runs), and every step
//! goes through a [`GameEntityMover`] the owning game backs with the
//! engine motor's [`commit_body_step`] -- the exact grid-collision
//! stand/slide/step rules the player uses. Blocked patrol and chase
//! movement steers on eight compass headings: keep a working heading,
//! re-aim at the goal on a per-entity countdown, and when blocked rank
//! the headings by how directly they close on the goal, with the reverse
//! last. This gives BSP-aware local routing without a navmesh, heap
//! allocation, or an unbounded search. Attack CONTACT resolution is the
//! combat slice (see [`crate::combat`]). Games with retained actor poses
//! use [`Self::tick_delta_deferred`] to freeze each active
//! swing's exact attack clip/phase, resolve authored capsules from the
//! same pose the body and equipment consume, and then latch the hit
//! through [`Self::connect_deferred_attack`]. The legacy immediate
//! front arc remains for games without retained-pose combat.
//! With zero cooked records every entry point returns immediately, so
//! a record-free game pays a handful of cycles per tick (measured in
//! the phase-3 budget's idle A/B).
//!
//! Crate rules hold: no statics, no unsafe, capacities are `const N`
//! parameters, cooked data arrives as `&'static` psx-level records,
//! and [`GameEntities::EMPTY`] is all-zero so the owning game can keep
//! the state in link-time-zero storage (`.bss`).
//!
//! [`commit_body_step`]: psx_engine::character_motor::commit_body_step
